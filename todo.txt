Next steps / ideas

- Add optional YouTube Data API v3 pagination (env: YOUTUBE_API_KEY) to fetch deeper history per channel.
- Document VIDEO_LIMIT and Shorts filtering in README; include examples.
- Support manual denylist by video ID for edge cases.
- Show duration and published date badges on video cards.
- Add a small script/CLI to purge and refresh the `.cache` for videos.
- Harden watch-page parsing and improve error logging when patterns change.
- Add lightweight tests for the RSS parser and Shorts detection logic.
- Optional: scrape channel /videos as a non-API fallback for older items.

Mission flow / content

- Reconceptualize Mission as guided steps (Learn → Reflect → Act → Share) with progress and email companion.
- Fill in content for new Faith articles (now stub pages exist under `src/mission/faith/`).
- Add Technological mission article cards (define topics + targets) and optional stubs.
