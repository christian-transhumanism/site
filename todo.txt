Next steps / ideas

- Support manual denylist by video ID for edge cases.
- Show duration and published date badges on video cards.
- Add a small script/CLI to purge and refresh the `.cache` for videos.
- Harden watch-page parsing and improve error logging when patterns change.
- Add lightweight tests for the RSS parser and Shorts detection logic.
- Optional: scrape channel /videos as a non-API fallback for older items.

Mission flow / content

- Reconceptualize Mission as guided steps (Learn → Reflect → Act → Share) with progress and email companion.
- Fill in content for new Faith articles (stub notes live under `src/cta-wiki/mission/faith/`).
- Add Technological mission article cards (define topics + targets) and optional stubs.

Content:

- I think we might need to work out a fourth "Ethics" pillar alongside Theology, Technology, Faith. 
- A page on Christ himself, glorifying him as this icon of the future, the beginning of infinity, the future of humanity, the ethical convergence of all our aspirations, and thus the ethical core of our transhumanist faith. What about him? Love, relationality, reconciliation. But also, that Christ is explanation and empowerment of others, and participation, so that his leadership is simultaneously the uplifting into leadership of all others; the only way to rise together.
- In a structural sense, this suggests bringing together the Wiki, the FAQ, and the Quotes pages in a deeper sense. I want to explore ideas for consolidating these things under Wiki, yet making them deeply integrated into the rest of the site, easily discoverable, and not siloed.
