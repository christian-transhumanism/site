### Ideas

### Three Conversions
**1. Ethical Techno-Optimism**. Technology can be used for significant good, when handled with appropriate ethical measures. We should pursue the technology and ethics to attain that good. 
**2. Religious Aspirations through Science**. Common religious visions, such as theosis, immortality, and resurrection, can be attained through science, technology, and ethics. We should pursue those ends. Part 1 of rational religion.
**3. Rationalist Religious Cosmology**. The largest structures of reality may reflect both our religious visions *and* our scientific and technological aspirations. For the religious, this means recasting religious visions in scientific and technological terms. For the secular, this means allowing science and technology to create openness to religious visions. Simulationism is a common example. Part 2 of rational religion.

### Three Audiences
1. Continuing Christians are committed people of faith, who ask *is my theology missing something?* They look for a new vision of what faith can do. 
2. Deconstructing Christians are people on the edge of faith, who ask *is faith actually meaningful, coherent, and relevant?* They look for a new vision of what faith is.
3. Secular Rationalists are people outside of faith, who see the world as framed around a scientific worldview. They ask *is religion rational?* They look for a new way to believe.
