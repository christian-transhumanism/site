# Theological Mission

In a world where Christians often see science and technology as enemies of faith---**We believe that science and technology are part of the mission of Christ and of God**. *We as a community need to be able to share this understanding of the Christian story.*

The CTA advocates for a hopeful, positive, optimistic, and empowering theology. We support theology that calls us to participation in the work of God, to the ethical imitation of Christ, and to a hopeful vision of the future.
