# Theological Mission

In a world where Christians often see science and technology as enemies of faith---**We believe that science and technology are part of the mission of Christ and of God**. *We as a community need to be able to share this understanding of the Christian story.*

As an association, not a denomination, the CTA seeks to seeks to draw theological themes on which Christians can agree, and that reflect the interaction Christianity must have with Transhumanism in a manner that will be mutually beneficial. Our distinctive emphasis is on **The Image of God**, as understood through these lenses:

1. The Creation Mandate
2. The Imitation of Christ / Participation in Christ
3. The Renewal of All Things

## Transhumanism is about the Image of God

At the 2019 Transvision conference in London, sociologist Steve Fuller declared that "Transhumanism is about the Image of God". For Christians, this connection makes sense, since we see our scientific and technological capacity as part of how we reflect God's own creative nature. We understand the image of God through these lenses:


## 1. The Creation Mandate

The Creation Mandate is the calling of Genesis 1 to create, cultivate, and uplift life—in Imitation of God.

God is a compassionate creator who empowers us to participate in the ongoing works of creation.

We are called to imitate God's benevolent work of creation. Technology is part of that imitation. Technology emerges from our creative nature.

The Universe appears constructed. Scientific questions are asked in the context of a universe with rules like a computer simulation would have.

The insights of those who suggest the Universe may be a Simulation echo the Bible's concept of "General Revelation" (Romans 1:20) that suggests humans can conceive we are living in a 'creation'. The Cosmological Argument for the existence of God can be restated as "Causation is a Feature of the Simulation/Creation".

Intentionally, carefully, and ethically creating the future is God's call on all humanity. Christians are called to be at the forefront of this work.

## 2. The Imitation of Christ

Christ's ethics are humility, love, and vocationally dedicating himself to the transformation of humanity. Scripture states, _"The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being."_ (Heb 1:3)

Christians are called to develop the characteristics of Christ. _"And we, who with unveiled faces contemplate the Lord's glory, are being transformed into his image with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit."_ (2 Cor 3:18) and, _"Put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness."_ (Eph 4:24) and _"In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus: Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death, even death on a cross! (Phil 2:5-8)_

Participation in the nature of Christ is a basic calling for all Christians.

The CTA advocates for Christians to express this humility and love of Christ by dedicating their lives and careers to useful technological development, and rejecting the empty display of consumerism, and false values of the secular world.

## 3. The Renewal of All Things

"_For the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed....in hope that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God."_ (Romans 8:19-21)

"_Truly, I tell you, at the renewal of all things…"_ — Jesus (Matt 19:28-30)

"…_until the time comes for the restoration of all things"_ — Peter (Acts 3:21)

"_Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven"_ Jesus (Matt 6:10)

Christians are called to work for the improvement of this present world. Escapist theologies bear bad fruit, such as a willingness to sacrifice the environment, awaiting a helicopter rescue from God, and failing to be salt and light for the preservation and enhancement of society.

The CTA interprets Scripture as expecting the world to continue to improve, and that the Rule of Christ's Principles will usher in unparalleled benefits for Earth.
