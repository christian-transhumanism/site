# Healthy and Holy: When the Goals of Asceticism Align with Transhumanism

by Dustin Ashley

In the age of rapid technological advancement, the merging of spiritual disciplines with transhumanist ideals might seem unlikely. Yet, a closer look reveals profound connections between the Christian tradition of asceticism and the goals of transhumanism. Both seek to refine the human condition—one through spiritual discipline and the other through technological enhancement. By exploring their intersections, we can uncover a unique dialogue that bridges the ancient and the futuristic.

**Understanding Asceticism**

Asceticism often conjures images of extreme deprivation or self-mortification, yet its essence lies in spiritual training—a disciplined practice aimed at refining both body and mind. Like an athlete preparing for competition, the ascetic seeks mastery through self-control and intentional sacrifice. These practices, which include fasting, celibacy, and extended periods of prayer, are designed to deepen one’s connection with God and cultivate moral and spiritual well-being.

Rooted in Jewish and Greek philosophical traditions, Christian asceticism draws on the teachings of thinkers such as Plato, Aristotle, and early Church fathers. Clement of Alexandria and Evagrius Ponticus. Clement regarded philosophy and Scripture as dual expressions of divine knowledge, while Evagrius emphasized the role of body and soul in aiding intellectual and spiritual clarity. By engaging in ascetic practices, Christians aim to achieve _apatheia_—a state of inner calm that fosters love and knowledge, ultimately leading to divine contemplation.

As Bonaventure eloquently stated, asceticism "prepares, fosters, and preserves perfection," enabling a deeper experience of God’s presence through gradual transformation.

**Ascetic Exercises**

**Prayer and Meditation**

At the heart of asceticism is prayer—an offering of speech and thought to God. Meditation serves as a complementary practice, filling the mind with divine truths and paving the way for contemplation, where the intellect experiences God directly. Bonaventure described this process in _The Mind’s Journey to God_, emphasizing the indwelling of God in the contemplative mind through overflowing charity.

**Fasting**

Fasting, another hallmark of asceticism, involves abstaining from certain foods or indulgences. While it often takes the form of a vegan diet, spiritual fasting extends to the renunciation of thoughts and actions that lead to vice. John Chrysostom highlighted fasting’s transformative power: "Fasting purifies the mind, calms the senses, subjects the flesh to the spirit, renders the heart humble and contrite, disperses the clouds of concupiscence, extinguishes the heat of passion, and lights up the fire of chastity."

**Repentance**

When spiritual discipline falters, repentance—or _metanoia_ (literally ‘mind changing’)—becomes essential. This practice involves turning the mind away from sin and confronting personal shortcomings to cultivate virtue. Forgiveness, both of oneself and others, is integral to this process. Gregory Palamas observed, "A person who repents from the soul reaches God by good intentions and avoidance of sin."

**Asceticism and Transhumanism**

Surprisingly, the principles underpinning asceticism resonate deeply with transhumanist aspirations. While transhumanism seeks to enhance human potential through technology, asceticism achieves similar goals through disciplined spiritual practices. These parallels reveal a shared commitment to refining the human experience.

**Meditation and Cognitive Health** Christian meditation, recognized as a form of prayer, or contemplation of the nature of the divine, or the lives and attributes of saints, has been shown to enhance mental well-being. A 2014 meta-analysis in _Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews_ (Kieran C.R. Fox et al) concluded that meditation induces moderate changes in brain areas linked to meta-awareness, emotional regulation, and inter-hemispheric communication. This aligns with transhumanist pursuits of cognitive enhancement and mental optimization.

**Fasting and Physical Longevity** Fasting’s health benefits are well-documented, particularly within transhumanist communities interested in life extension. Intermittent fasting, a practice embraced by many, has been shown to mitigate metabolic disorders and slow cognitive decline, as evidenced by Alicja Grzelak’s 2025 study in the _Journal of Education, Health, and Sport_. Such findings echo the ascetic understanding of fasting as a pathway to holistic health.

**Repentance and Moral Progress** The cultivation of virtue through repentance aligns with transhumanism’s ethos of continuous progress. Emerging discussions on "moral transhumanism" draw on virtue ethics, with theologians and philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas providing a framework for integrating morality into technological advancement. This shared emphasis on ethical development underscores the compatibility of Christian transhumanism with broader transhumanist goals.

**Common Ground: Caring for the Body and Soul**

Both asceticism and transhumanism affirm the importance of caring for the body and soul. Ascetics view the body as a vessel for spiritual growth, requiring discipline and refinement to align with divine purpose. Transhumanists, similarly, seek to transcend biological limitations to achieve greater well-being and fulfillment.

This convergence invites a richer understanding of how ancient spiritual disciplines can inform modern technological pursuits. By embracing practices like prayer, fasting, and repentance, we not only honor our spiritual heritage but also engage in a transformative dialogue that unites faith and innovation.

**Conclusion**

The alignment of ascetic and transhumanist ideals offers a compelling vision for holistic human flourishing. As we navigate the intersection of ancient wisdom and cutting-edge technology, we are reminded that the pursuit of health and holiness is not mutually exclusive. Instead, it is a shared journey toward greater understanding, virtue, and communion with the divine.
