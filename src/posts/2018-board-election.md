Since our public launch almost three years ago, the **Christian Transhumanist Association** has been working hard to advance the conversation between Christianity and the leading edges of technological thought.   
  
From our first major action funding the <a href="https://www.christiantranshumanism.org/blog/embrace_announcement" target="_blank">Embrace Infant Warmer project</a>—uniting our values of technology, compassion, and respect for human life—to authoring the historic <a href="https://www.christiantranshumanism.org/join" target="_blank">Christian Transhumanist Affirmation</a> in conjunction with academics, clergy, technologists, and laypersons—we’ve helped set the tone for a positive engagement between religion and the deepest and most challenging issues of our time.   
  
We’ve carried this message **across the country**, from secular transhumanist conferences in California, to Redeemer Presbyterian Church in NYC—and **around the world**, from Lagos, Nigeria to Vina Del Mar, Chile. We’ve appeared in major publications, both religious and non-religious, and our members have been interviewed for podcasts, articles, videos, and even *The Daily Show*.   
  
At the same time, we’ve advised on documentaries, hosted Reddit AMAs, and cultivated conversations with some of the <a href="http://brickcaster.com/christiantranshumanist" target="_blank">leading thinkers</a> in technology and religion. We've brought together the prestigious Christian Transhumanist <a href="https://www.christiantranshumanism.org/blog/academic-advisory-council-announcement" target="_blank">Academic Advisory Council</a>. And most of all, we’ve formed <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ChristianTranshumanistAssociation/" target="_blank">deep relationships</a> with many people working for positive change, just like you.  
  
**We're just getting started.** We've got big plans for the year ahead, and we need hard-working, insightful leaders to help bring those plans to fruition.   
  
<a href="http://bit.ly/CTANominees2018" target="_blank">**This month, we're electing *three new members* to the Board of the Christian Transhumanist Association.**</a>  
  
Who will those people be?  
  
**That’s up to you.** <a href="http://bit.ly/CTANominees2018" target="_blank">Nominations are now open</a>. We're looking for the people who can help lead these important efforts into the future. Maybe that’s someone you know. Maybe it’s *you*.  
  
After we finish collecting nominations, our <a href="https://www.christiantranshumanism.org/join" target="_blank">voting members</a> will elect the new board.   
  
If you’re not a voting member of the association, this is a great time to become one. You’ll not only help advance this incredibly important conversation, you’ll have a direct voice in who will lead it over the next three years.

I believe this conversation is one of the most important efforts of our time, and I’ve dedicated myself completely to it. I’d love for you to join us.  
  
Upward!  
  
Micah Redding
Executive Director
