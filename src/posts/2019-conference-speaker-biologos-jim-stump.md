[BioLogos](https://biologos.org/people/jim-stump) is an organization at the forefront of Faith & Science dialogue. Founded by Francis Collins—who led the Human Genome Project and now directs the National Institutes of Health—BioLogos advocates a strong embrace of current scientific understanding, while showing that science is not in conflict with the Bible, but actually enhances faith.

[Jim Stump](https://biologos.org/people/jim-stump) is Vice-President of BioLogos, and the host of the podcast [Language of God](https://biologos.org/podcast/language-of-god). He has a PhD in philosophy and was formerly a professor and academic administrator. His books include, “Four Views on Creation, Evolution, and Intelligent Design”; “Science and Christianity: An Introduction to the Issues”; “How I Changed My Mind about Evolution”; and “The Blackwell Companion to Science and Christianity”.

He will be speaking on applying the lessons learned from engaging faith and evolution, to the questions of faith and transhumanism.

The 2019 [Christian Transhumanist Conference](https://www.christiantranshumanism.org/conference/2019) will be held October 19, 2019 in Nashville, TN. The keynote speaker is [“Science Mike” McHargue](https://www.christiantranshumanism.org/podcast/21), a former atheist who discovered God in science.
