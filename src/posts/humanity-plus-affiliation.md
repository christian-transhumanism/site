[Humanity+](http://humanityplus.org/about/affiliates/) is one of the leading advocates of the ethical use of technology to expand human capacities. In their prior incarnation as the World Transhumanist Association, they adopted the historic [Transhumanist Declaration](http://humanityplus.org/philosophy/transhumanist-declaration/), and helped pioneer the modern discussion of how science and technology can and will affect our human future.

The [Christian Transhumanist Association](https://www.christiantranshumanism.org/) is the first explicitly transhumanist organization aimed at bringing this conversation to the wider Christian world. Through theological and social engagement, the CTA encourages Christians to use science & technology to participate in the work of God, to cultivate life and renew creation.

Humanity+ has recently added the CTA to its small list of [officially-recognized affiliates](http://humanityplus.org/about/affiliates/), joining other long-standing transhumanist organizations like the Foresight Institute, SENS Research Foundation, Alcor Life Extension Foundation, the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, and the Mormon Transhumanist Association.

The CTA is pleased to affiliate with Humanity+, and is proud to be recognized as a positive addition to the larger transhumanist community.
