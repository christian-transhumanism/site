<p>H+ magazine has published Chris Benek's essay on the difference between a transhumanism that's really only looking out for individual advancement, versus a transhumanism that's truly working towards human advancement.</p>
<p>This is a big discussion in the transhumanist world at the moment, and it's something that religious and spiritual transhumanists have an important view into. Religions and spiritual traditions have spent thousands of years seeking to find the right balance between individual needs and society-level concerns.</p>
