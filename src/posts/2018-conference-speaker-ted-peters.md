**The Promise and Peril of Technological Hope**  
*God has promised a New Jerusalem where "death will be no more; mourning and crying and pain will be no more...'See, I am making all things new'." (Revelation 21:4-5). Inspired by this vision, Christian transhumanists rightly steward scientific and technological innovation on behalf of exploration and discovery as well as work against illness, hunger, oppression, injustice, and death. However, a peril lurks in the risk of unrealistically expecting from technological progress something that only God's grace can deliver, namely, the healing and redemption of the human will.*
