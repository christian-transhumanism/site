For much of the past year, the board and I have been thinking about the mission and purpose of the CTA. And we've realized that we really have three missions:

1.  First, **a theological mission**. In a world where Christians often see science and technology as enemies of faith---**We believe that science and technology are part of the mission of Christ and of God**. *We as a community need to be able to share this understanding of the Christian story.*

2.  Second, **a faith-renewing and revitalizing mission**. In a world of rising skepticism and disenchantment---**We believe that engaging the future can help faith come alive**. *We as a community need to be able to show how the future can renew our faith, and the faith of individuals, families, communities, and the world.*

3.  Third, **a technological mission**. In a world of increasingly difficult ethical questions and challenges---**We believe that Christ offers an ethical vision for scientific and technological progress**. *We as a community need to be able to articulate and advocate for that ethical vision, and to enact it progressively in our own lives, and in the world around us.*

These are our three missions. A theological mission, to explain how science and technology fit into the purpose of Christ and of God. A faith-renewing and revitalizing mission, to show how the future can renew our faith. A technological mission, to advocate the ethical vision of Christ for science and technology.

Which of these missions is most important to you? Which one do you resonate with the most?
