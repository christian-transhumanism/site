<p><a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/why-i-became-a-christian-transhumanist">Motherboard</a> has published an article by Micah Redding on the growth of Christian transhumanism, and why Christians are beginning to look towards&nbsp;<span>space exploration, artificial intelligence, radical life extension, cyborgs, and cryogenics as tools for fulfilling the Christian mission.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just as the printing press gained incredible religious significance during the Protestant Reformation, we may see the next wave of Christians embrace transhumanist technologies as part of a sacred duty to participate with God in the redemption of the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Maybe missionaries will embark on cryonic missions to the future. Maybe would-be “Noahs” will take vast arks full of the DNA of endangered species, and head towards the stars. Maybe Christian computer scientists will take seriously the responsibility of a creator to its creatures, and treat new artificial intelligences not as monsters, but as beings deserving of love.</p>
