<p>Our campaign is over 50% funded, and we&rsquo;ve got 6 days to go!<br /><br />As you know, at the beginning of this month, the Christian Transhumanist Association announced&nbsp;<a href="http://www.christiantranshumanism.org/announcement" target="_blank">its launch</a>, membership campaign, and logo-design effort, all at the same time.</p>
<p>Since then, we&rsquo;ve had great conversations, seen new discussions pop up on Reddit, Twitter, and in diverse corners of the internet, and discovered new voices writing about Christianity and transhumanism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an exciting moment. The ideas that we propose seem poised on the edge of widespread discussion. Transhumanism is moving into the public consciousness, and with it, an awareness of the need for a thoroughly compassionate, comprehensive approach to our humanity and our future.&nbsp;<br /><br /> As we move into this next month, we&rsquo;ll be starting our logo design process, as well as electing our first Members Advisory Council. The council will be selected by our Voting Members (those who have contributed $100 or more, <a style="-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%; color: #202020; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.christiantranshumanism.org/donate" target="_blank">here</a>), and will profoundly shape who we become, moving forward. Obviously, we would love to have as many of you as possible involved in this process. If you haven&rsquo;t yet had the opportunity to <strong><a style="-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%; color: #202020; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.christiantranshumanism.org/donate" target="_blank">sign up</a></strong>, now is a great time.<br /><br /> And of course, regardless of whether you can contribute financially or not, we value your voice, and want you to join us. Sign up as an official member, for free, <strong><a style="-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%; color: #202020; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.christiantranshumanism.org/join" target="_blank">here</a></strong>.<br /><br /> Be thinking about who you would like to nominate for the council. I believe that we are in the middle of an incredibly important conversation, that will be significant to people for years to come. We want to approach this conversation with all the wisdom, grace, and humility that we can muster.<br /><br /> Thanks for helping to make this conversation a reality!<br /><br /> Micah Redding<br /> Executive Director, CTA<br /> &nbsp;</p>
