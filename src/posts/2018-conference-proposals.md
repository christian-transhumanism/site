The Christian Transhumanist Association is pleased to announce that the first ever [Christian Transhumanist Conference](https://www.christiantranshumanism.org/conference) will take place on Saturday, 25 August 2018, at Lipscomb University in Nashville, TN.

The keynote speaker is [Aubrey de Grey](https://www.christiantranshumanism.org/podcast/36), a life extension advocate and radical longevity researcher, working to end aging and create biological immortality through science.

How will biological immortality impact our understanding of Humanity? How will it impact Faith? Is the pursuit of immortality a moral necessity—or a sin? Will it fulfill the age-old dreams of religion?
