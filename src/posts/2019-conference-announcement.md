The Christian Transhumanist Association is pleased to announce a one-day conference this October with keynote speaker *Science Mike McHargue*. The event will be held in Nashville, TN on Saturday, October 19th. 

Science Mike became a skeptic through science, then found God as an atheist. As the host of *Ask Science Mike*, he addresses wide-ranging questions on science and faith, and as a co-host of *The Liturgists Podcast*, he reaches millions of people navigating questions of spirituality and meaning.

More details will be announced over the next few weeks, but we wanted to give everyone notice in order to "save the date" and make necessary travel arrangements.

For more information on our keynote speaker, check out his [website](https://mikemchargue.com), or listen to an interview with him [here](https://www.christiantranshumanism.org/podcast/21). 

For more information on Christian Transhumanism, and our mission to work against illness, hunger, oppression, injustice, and death, visit our webpage at www.christiantranshumanism.org.

A [Call for Presentations](https://www.christiantranshumanism.org/conference_proposals) is available.  

[Tickets are available here](https://christian-transhumanist-conference-2019.eventbrite.com).

We look forward to seeing you in Nashville in October!
