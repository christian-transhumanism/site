<p>In case you haven&rsquo;t heard, our campaign was a success!</p>
<p>We raised $1175, registered our first set of voting association members, and signed up a number of new volunteers and supporters. And along the way, we made new friends, discovered powerful new voices, and participated in stimulating conversations on Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, and email.</p>
<p><em>Thank you</em> to all of our donors, and to all of you who offered your energy and time. <em>Thank you</em>&nbsp;to everyone who spread the word about the association, whether to your own social networks, or to individuals you knew would find it meaningful. <em>Thank you</em>&nbsp;to all of you who reached out over email or web or social media to express your support.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been impressed by how much this conversation really means to people. For some, it&rsquo;s provocative; for others, it&rsquo;s compelling. For still others, it is long overdue.</p>
<p>Over the next month, we&rsquo;ll be taking some significant new steps. As we do, we want your input in every possible way. If there is a project you believe in, or a way you want to contribute, don&rsquo;t hesitate to let us know. Thanks for being part of this team!</p>
