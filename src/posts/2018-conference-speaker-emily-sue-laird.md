The Christian Transhumanist Association is pleased to announce that Emily Sue Laird will present at the first [Christian Transhumanist Conference](https://www.christiantranshumanism.org/conference-tickets), on August 25th, at Lipscomb University in Nashville, TN.

**Emily Sue Laird** is a Nashville-based commercial artist, educator, and civil servant specializing in visual arts and 3D printing. She earned a BFA in Fine Art from Watkins College of Art, Design & Film—and currently serves at one of Nashville's high-tech maker spaces for teenagers, where she teaches visual arts and technology programs.

As Creative Director of *Artist Nashville* from 2014-2017, Emily Sue was responsible for the design and production of large scale contemporary sculptural installations. A few of her notable clients include Jack Daniel's Distillery, Holiday Inn Suites, Cox Automotive, Cengage, Janet's Planet, and the YMCA.

In August 2017, the Tennessee Arts Commission awarded Emily Sue a grant to work with local young adults to create a large-scale mural at the *Adventure Science Center* in Nashville, TN—featuring fractal-based mathematical designs and blacklight-responsive paints to teach visitors concepts about math, science, and light. In Summer 2018, Ms. Laird and the Adventure Science Center were awarded a grant by the *Nashville Metro Arts Commission* to create large scale outer-space themed art with middle schoolers in under-served communities, surrounding the Sudekum Planetarium.

Emily Sue Laird will be presenting on **Art & Transhumanism**.
