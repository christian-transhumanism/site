Since [our formation](https://www.christiantranshumanism.org/history) over seven years ago, the **Christian Transhumanist Association** has been working hard to advance the conversation between Christianity and the leading edges of technological thought.

From our first major action funding the [Embrace Infant Warmer project](https://www.christiantranshumanism.org/blog/embrace_announcement)—uniting our values of technology, compassion, and respect for human life—to authoring the historic [Christian Transhumanist Affirmation](https://www.christiantranshumanism.org/affirmation) in conjunction with academics, clergy, and technologists—we've helped set the tone for a positive engagement between religion and the deepest and most challenging issues of our time.

We've carried this message around the globe, engaging both secular and religious audiences. We've appeared in major publications, like **Wired, Christianity Today, and the BBC**, and our members have been interviewed for numerous podcasts, articles, videos, and even *The Daily Show*.

In 2018 and 2019, we took a massive leap, organizing an incredible series of **Christian Transhumanist Conferences**, and drawing people from around the world. In 2020 and 2021, we moved much of this discussion online, launching a series of monthly talks, and exploring new mediums opening up. Along the way, we heard from [leading thinkers](https://www.christiantranshumanism.org/podcast) in technology and religion, discussed [big, exciting ideas](https://www.christiantranshumanism.org/conference), and most of all—formed [deep relationships](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ChristianTranshumanistAssociation/) with many people working for positive change, just like you.

These have been fantastic experiences, and we're excited to keep moving forward.

**We're just getting started.** We've got big plans for the year ahead, and we need hard-working, insightful leaders to help bring those plans to fruition.

**Jonathan Gunnell, Mike Morrell, Mark Russell, and Blaire Ostler** have just completed several fantastic years of service in CTA leadership. Which means that [**this month, we're electing new members to the Board of the Christian Transhumanist Association.**](http://bit.ly/CTANominees2021)

Who will those people be?

**That's up to you.** [Nominations are now open](http://bit.ly/CTANominees2021). We're looking for the people who can help lead these important efforts into the future. Maybe that's someone you know. Maybe it's *you*.

After we finish collecting nominations, our [voting members](https://www.christiantranshumanism.org/join) will elect the new board.

If you're not a voting member of the association, this is a great time to become one. You'll not only help advance this incredibly important conversation, you'll have a direct voice in who will lead it over the next three years.

I believe this conversation is one of the most important efforts of our time, and I've dedicated myself completely to it. I'd love for you to join us.

Upward!

Micah Redding
Executive Director
