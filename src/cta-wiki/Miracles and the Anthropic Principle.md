[[Micah Redding]] wrote an essay entitled [Miracles and the Anthropic Principle](https://www.micahredding.com/blog/2012/04/11/miracles-and-anthropic-principle/), which takes the position that the Anthropic Principle applies to history, just as it does to physical constants, and other possible [[Fine-Tuning Argument|Fine-Tunings]]. This in turn suggests that miracles may be expected in history, and that miracles may be evidence of constraints on possible universes, and/or evidence of near extinction events in our past.

### Central concept
- A corollary of the Anthropic Principle is that we can only observe ourselves to be in histories which are compatible with our current existence
- There is nothing which prevents such histories from being rare
- In fact, the [[Great Filter]] interpretation of the [[Fermi Paradox]] suggests such histories *are* rare
- The rarity of such histories implies one or more *close calls* or seemingly impossible events
- Thus, we may have reason to expect miracles in history

### Miracles as Close Calls
- [[Miracles do not break the laws of physics]]
- Miracles can be defined as events which are *improbable* and *significant*
- Close calls are the prime example of events which are improbable and significant
- Many claimed miracles appear to be such close calls
	- eg, The parting of the Red Sea
- Many other claimed miracles may be close calls, when understood in a large enough context
	- eg, perhaps the [[Resurrection of Christ]] is necessary for the rise of a technological civilization, or to otherwise escape the [[Great Filter]]

### Implications
- Miracle claims may provide evidence of close calls in history
- Miracle claims may be corroborated by theories which entail close calls
