[[Nikolai Fedorov (1829-1903)|Fedorov]] personal life:
Raised mostly by father's family, taken from mother
Wore a beard to affiliate with the ancient patriarchs
Strong-willed character

> I would make bold to submit that Mr. Fedorov, owing to the coarseness and impudence of his character, as well as to the nature of his thoughts, __nourished by the harmful false doctrines of the West: equality, liberty, and the rejection of authority__ and absolute indifference toward official obligations, can no longer be tolerated in his present position

In reality, this was not his nature at all. [1][#Young2012]
