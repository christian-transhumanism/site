# The Faith Principle

The Faith Principle holds that we must always act in the face of uncertainty, and that this requires a stance of bold hope, rational and ethical evaluation of plausible futures, and committed action towards the best possibilities.

> Science is fragmentary and incomplete; it advances but slowly and is never finished; but life cannot wait. (Emile Durkheim)

The Faith Principle does not oppose rationality, science, or evidence. Rather, it recognizes rationality and science as necessary tools in the identification of the best and most plausible futures. 

The Faith Principle does not wait for rational or scientific evaluation to be complete. Knowing that inaction is often more dangerous than action, it acts on the best available knowledge, or even knowledge that is “good enough”.

The Faith Principle does not limit its analysis to rational and scientific plausibility. It recognizes that some plausible outcomes may be unethical, while some implausible outcomes may be the only ethical options available. When there are few good options, it takes committed action towards the best possibilities, even if those possibilities seem extremely remote.

The Faith Principle is supported by two asymmetries:

1. Hope allows for the conception of positive futures. Hopelessness eliminates that possibility.
2. Action expands the possibilities for success. Inaction narrows those possibilities.

The Faith Principle assumes:

- **Fallibilism**. Our knowledge is always incomplete and provisional. Reality is real, and consequential. Therefore, we must adopt a stance of humility and continued openness to learning and discovery.
- **Optimism**. Even in a state of uncertainty, progress is possible, and positive outcomes can be attained.
- **Tradition**. We come to any situation with a set of pre-existing ideas and resources. We may revise, refine, and radically reimagine these ideas and resources, yet we are always starting with what already exists.
- **Progress**. We can and must improve upon what we have inherited. 
- **Imagination**. All plans and understandings start with imagination. We conjecture new possibilities, and then flesh them out into theories and explanations. To cultivate understanding, we must cultivate imagination. To cultivate imagination, we must cultivate hope.
- **Reconciliation**. All knowledge must seek reconciliation—whether with material reality, by experimental testing, or with other people and other bodies of knowledge, by exposing our theories to challenge and critique. Even though we must act before we reach full reconciliation, all of our actions aim towards reconciliation as an ultimate eventuality.
- **Commitment**. No scientific experiment can be performed without commitment to carry it through. No progress is possible without commitment to a process. Thus, we cultivate faithfulness, the ability to commit to and pursue the best possibilities, even in the face of setback and discouragement.
- **Action**. “Faith without works is dead” (James 2:26). A faith that encourages apathy or inaction is not faith at all. So too, a faith that encourages willful ignorance is not faith.

> We stand on a mountain pass in the midst of whirling snow and blinding mist, through which we get glimpses now and then of paths which may be deceptive. If we stand still we shall be frozen to death. If we take the wrong road we shall be dashed to pieces. We do not certainly know whether there is any right one. What must we do? 'Be strong and of a good courage.' Act for the best, hope for the best, and take what comes...If death ends all, we cannot meet death better.
