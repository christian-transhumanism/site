~ Fedorov; Humans were created to be the heavenly powers #quote

> Our ancient Russia never doubted that the answer to the question 'What has man been created for?' is that humans were created to be the heavenly powers replacing the fallen angels, God's divine instruments for governing the Universe and restoring it to the incorruptible magnificence it had before the Fall.

[[Nikolai Fedorov (1829-1903)|Fedorov]]
