claim or idea in [[David Bentley Hart; You Are Gods]]

- [[David Bentley Hart|DBH]] says Paul makes this clear, because Paul intentionally creates ambiguity between "The Spirit" and "your spirit" (this has long been noted in commentaries)
- [[David Bentley Hart|DBH]] says God breathing the Spirit in Genesis 2 equates God's Spirit and our spirit 

> "Bulgakov is surely right, and on the soundest scriptural ground, when he speaks of the human spirit as that which is uncreated in humanity, and that which proceeds from God as an outpouring from his essence; and Bulgakov is right also in saying that, in creation, God calls his own breath to hypostatic existence—calls his own Spirit to indwell his creatures as their spirits—and thereby gives hypostatic life to the rays of his own glory.
