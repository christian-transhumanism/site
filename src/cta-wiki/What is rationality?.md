Rationality is the approach to the world that seeks knowledge, and power through knowledge.

*Knowledge is power*, because knowledge allows you to accomplish things by working with the grain and flow of the world, rather than against it. Knowledge is the most ethical form of power, because knowledge allows you to meet the needs and desires of others, while also meeting your own needs. Knowledge eliminates the need for [[zero-sum games]], in favor of cooperative possibilities.

Knowledge consists of good explanations. Good explanations are those which have been severely tested, and yet survive.

### The Methodology of Reason

Reason derives from the act of *reasoning*, sharing explanations with other people, and allowing them to critique those explanations.

Good explanations that have undergone heavy critique, and have yet survived, constitute *knowledge*.
