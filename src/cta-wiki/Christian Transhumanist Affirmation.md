As members of the Christian Transhumanist Association:

**1. We believe that God’s mission involves the transformation and renewal of creation** including humanity, and that we are called by Christ to participate in that mission: working against illness, hunger, oppression, injustice, and death.

**2. We seek growth and progress along every dimension of our humanity:** spiritual, physical, emotional, mental—and at all levels: individual, community, society, world.  

**3. We recognize science and technology as tangible expressions of our God-given impulse to explore and discover** and as a natural outgrowth of being created in the image of God.

**4. We are guided by Jesus’ greatest commands** to “Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength…and love your neighbor as yourself.”

**5. We believe that the intentional use of technology, coupled with following Christ, can empower us to grow into our identity** as humans made in the image of God.

In this way we are Christian Transhumanists.
