It may sometimes feel like that, but a more biblical account would recognize the strange, steady work of God within so-called natural causes as well, so that the sudden and shocking new event is held within a larger continuum of ultimate divine causation."

> Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and all that night the Lord drove the sea back with a strong east wind and turned it into dry land. The waters were divided, and the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with a wall of water on their right and on their left. (Exodus 14:21-22)

> ...for, saith our Saviour, You err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God; laying before us two books or volumes to study if we will be secured from error; first the Scriptures revealing the will of God, and then the creatures expressing his power; **for that latter book will certify us that nothing which the first teacheth shall be thought impossible**. And most sure it is, and a true conclusion of experience, that a little natural philosophy inclineth the mind to atheism, but a further proceeding bringeth the mind back to religion.

Miracles can be defined as events which are *improbable* and *meaningful*. 

Many contemporary definitions claim that miracles break the laws of physics. However, this is a new definition, not found in ancient philosophy or scripture.

And worryingly, this definition seems to deny foundational Christian theological truths, such as that God is the creator, that the natural world submits to God's will, and that humans are called to exercise the same kind of dominion, and to do the works of God.

In contrast to these contemporary definitions of *miracle*, the Bible explains the parting of the Red Sea in terms of natural phenomena (a strong east wind). This does not make it not-a-miracle, but rather, makes it a miracle that God achieved by natural means. 

Accordingly, early Christians anticipated and theorized about [[Scientific Resurrection]], knowing that God had created the material world to be suitable for his purposes, including his intent to resurrect everyone. The resurrection would be a miracle, but one that was understandable through science.
