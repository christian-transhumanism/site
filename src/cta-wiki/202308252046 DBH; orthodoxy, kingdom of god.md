202308252046 DBH; orthodoxy, kingdom of god

Paraphrase:

> “[in] Orthodoxy…salvation is cosmic in scope and includes all creation…the promised Kingdom of God will be this world restored and transfigured…a deified humanity will serve as a cosmic priesthood, receiving glory from Christ and mediating it to the natural world.” ~ DBH

Original:

> Had Feser been fortunate enough to be catechized into Orthodoxy…he would surely have been told that salvation is cosmic in scope and includes all creation; that the promised Kingdom of God will be nothing but this world restored and transfigured by the glory of God, in its every dimension, vegetal, animal, rational, and social; and that a deified humanity will serve therein as a cosmic priesthood, receiving that glory from Christ and mediating it to the natural world.
