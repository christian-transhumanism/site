New approaches to arguing for Christianity that we find emerging in the modern world:

- Arguments that lean towards pragmatic considerations
	- [[Christianity is the origin]]
	- [[Christianity is necessary]]
	- [[Christianity is a load-bearing wall]]
	- [[Christianity is the ultimate memetic attractor]]
- Arguments that use a different epistemology
	- We can simply conjecture God/Christ/Christianity
	- We can believe if we desire to do so
	- You should want Christianity to be true
		- eg: because it's the best story, because it's ultimately the only hopeful story, or because it's the only way through the [[Great Filter]], or the only good outcome of [[Simulation Argument]]
- Arguments that lean on core mysteries:
	- Core mysteries:
		- Existence of the universe
		- Fine-tuning of the universe
		- Possibility of computation (not a given) â€” [[Computation as Fine-Tuning]]
		- Existence of rational minds within the universe
		- Hard problem of consciousness
	- Perhaps the best explanation of these mysteries involves recognizing a central significance to personhood
	- A universe in which personhood is significant is a universe that looks theistic, and arguably, Christian
