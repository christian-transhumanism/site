# Who We Are

We are *Christian Transhumanists*: Christians who, because of our commitment to our faith, are also Transhumanists.

While many expressions of transhumanism are secular or anti-religious, transhumanism itself is simply a philosophy which states that we should use science and technology to make the world (including humanity) better. We advocate a form of transhumanism centered on Christ.

The Christian Transhumanist Association advances the [Christian Transhumanist Affirmation](/affirmation/), currently understood in terms of our [Three-Fold Mission](/mission/).

### Historical Statements

When we were in the process of formation, our small community used several guiding statements and concepts. <a href="/history">Read more about our history here.</a> These statements included:

**Our Purpose**: Participating with God in the redemption, reconciliation, and renewal of the world.

**Our Understanding**: We understand our Christian faith to affirm humans as scientific and technological creatures—creatures who create and discover, and who are commissioned to cultivate life, create new things, and renew the world. We further understand our Christian mission to charge us with healing, feeding, and restoring life—activities which provoke us to scientific and medical innovations, just as they have throughout Christian history.

**Our Affirmation**: The [Christian Transhumanist Affirmation](/affirmation/), written in cooperation with clergy, theologians, and people from all kinds of backgrounds&mdash;is our attempt to express the outlines of what it means to be a Christian Transhumanist.

**Our Statement of Principle and Action**: As part of our affirmation, we include a <strong>Statement of Principle and Action</strong> taken from Jesus himself:

<em>Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength&hellip;and love your neighbor as yourself.</em>

That contains our purpose, our defining focus, and our message. And when it comes to the application of those commands, we see three deep things:

1. We focus on that which is transcendent.
2. We pursue greater coherence of mentality, physicality, spirituality.
3. We seek the betterment of the world.

We think that these three elements define what it is to be a complete human being, and mark out the dimensions along which we should grow. They define what we hope to practice as an organization, what will shape our choices, and what we hope to convey in many ways and forms to the outside world.
