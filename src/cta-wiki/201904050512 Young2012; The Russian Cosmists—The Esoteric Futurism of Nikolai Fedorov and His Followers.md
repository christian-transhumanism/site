Preface has a content warning. Only religious ideas deserve and demand content warnings. Because religious ideas are virulent ideas, designed to turn your mind.

The "defining genetic mark" of Cosmist thought is "active evolution".

Humanity is to be formed into a single organism, which is said to result in a higher "planetarian consciousness", which will lead to new ethical and physical progress. 

I'm struck by the similarity to [[Alexander Campbell]]'s Millennial aim, which saw [[201904050557]] unity as a precursor to the Millennial Kingdom. As I've said elsewhere, I think this is backwards.

The Russian Mind pursues unity. Similar to how [[201904050601]] Growing up in the One True Church predisposes you to transhumanism.

> the Cosmists also characteristically display an emphasis on the "Russianness" of their projects, a suggestion-sometimes even an insistence-that being Russian has somethingto do with the cosmic scope of their creative thought, that a Slavic instinct for expansiveness, wholeness, unity, and total solutions underlies the global, and beyond-global character oftheir investigations and projects.

The Cosmists were geniuses of unusual, seemingly conflicting tendencies and pursuits.

### Precursors to the Cosmists

1792. Radishchev suggests that man is not the end of evolution
1869. Prince Vladimir Odoevsk wrote a science fiction novel about the year 4338
1903. Sukhovo-Kobylin (1817-1903)
    - posits three stages of human evolution:
        1. earthbound man. inhabiting the earth
        2. solar man. inhabiting the solar system
        3. sidereal man. inhabiting the cosmos
    - "the infinite City of God" â€” the city spread across the cosmos?
    - The bicycle represented "horizontal flight" â€” I've had this thought
    - We need to progress from mechanical to organic wings, and escape gravity through mechanical invention. Seems to suggest mechanical is not opposed to organic.
    - Evolving towards God means growing smaller/faster toward a singularity

### Context of the Cosmists

- Russia has a historic mission, following its own trajectory of progress, rather than imitating the West. 
- This path is to integrate science / spirituality.
- "Orthodoxy, Autocracy, Nationality". The aim for the ultimate Orthodox Church, which will resurrect the dead, and the ultimate Autocrat, who will rule the physical world.
- Russian thought always understands thought as a call to action
    - Thus rapid Marxism
- Russian thought sees _Submission_ as the eternal goal of the human mind
    - Christianity's virtue is its universal claims, and dominating force
    - Submission to nature makes us fused with the ultimate will, the divine will
- Russian Spirituality pursues the Kingdom of God on Earth
    - Russian Orthodox Easter prefigures the Eschaton
    - Thus, Marxism
    - > Whether it will be the Kingdom of God or of perfect Communism, Russians have traditionally believed with special intensity... And that kingdom is to come, emphatically, not in some sweet by-and-by up yonder, but in our time and here on earth.
- Russian Spirituality pursues the Kingdom of God within
    - The singular aim of Christianity is to possess the Holy Spirit of God
    - Theosis
- Russian Spirituality admires Eastern Orthodoxy for pragmatic, embodied, public theology (icons), instead of abstract intellectual theology
    - The alternative is slavery to intellect (Aquinas), imagination (Dante), and power (Pope)
    - > Catholicism stands for unity without freedom, Protestantism for freedom without unity, and Orthodoxy for sobornost', the synthesis of freedom and unity, wholeness, communality, spiritual consensus.
- Werewolves as reminders we can devolve, return to being subhuman
- Russian rulers have long history of magic. Rasputin makes sense.
- > Fedorov would propose that all matter contains the dust of ancestors, and that traces of ancestral dust could be extracted and used not to do hostile magic but scientifically, to restore life to the departed.
- [[201904052124 Cosmism > Technology must be focused on doing good]]

[[201904072204]] The Russian landscape leads to antagonism between Humanity & Nature.
Fedorov sees nature-worship as a death-wish.

### [[Nikolai Fedorov (1829-1903)|Nikolai Fedorovich Fedorov]]
[[201904052311]] Fedorov personal life
[[201901120212]] Tolstoy knew/knew of Fedorov
[[201904072157]] Fedorov condemned Tolstoy as a Buddhist
Dostoevsky knew Fedorov
1. Active resurrection occurs to Fedorov. [[Scientific Resurrection]]
2. Fedorov had already worked out the main lines of his entire project by 1864.
[[201904060117]] All philosophies agree on death. Except Fedorov.
[[201904052126]] Two kinds of Death
[[201904052204]] Cosmism > Unity through the Common Task of Resurrection
[[201904052131]] Fedorov anticipated Quantum Archaeology, cosmic diffusion of data
[[201904052129]] Resurrection requires Space Exploration

Cosmism > Spirituality without Technology leads to a dead end 

> And further, also in contrast to some of the other Cosmist thinkers, he believed that spiritual development alone, without scientific technology, could also lead only to a dead end.

Cosmism > The Pursuit of Knowledge for its own sake leads to War

> Moreover, by pursuing knowledge for its own sake and scorning all practical application of knowledge, Fedorov argued, the learned merely aided those who would wage war. The learned contribute to the waging of war either directly, by discoveries which can be turned into weapons, or indirectly, by allowing their discoveries to be turned into articles of commerce, which leads to competition, which then inevitably leads to war.

Oof

```
Fedorov would later write that the most serious and destructive division between people was not between rich and poor but between the learned and the unlearned. Those of the learned class, he argued, had separated themselves from the unlearned masses, from the soil, from their origins, from their fathers, and, ultimately, from nature, God, and life. 

The learned, who had the knowledge to control the blind, destructive forces of nature, did not feel the need to do so. Living in cities, insensible to nature's brute power, the learned viewed nature merely from an aesthetic standpoint.

The unlearned, on the other hand, who knew and had to bear the brunt of nature's blind force every day, had the desire but lacked the knowledge to exercise control.

To the learned, nature was a matter of beauty or ugliness, to the unlearned, a matter of life and death.
```

- Fedorov believed to be human (as one ought to be) is to be free from death, and engaged in the task of bringing immortality to others.
- (Could birth be replaced by resurrection?)


Humanity already serves one goal: war
Simply reorient: 
Horizontal to Vertical, Weapon to Tool, Cannon to Weather Control, "Sword to Plowshare"

[[201904060119]] Cosmism > War on Nature as Unification through Common Task


Fedorov convinces a communist that he doesn't care about material good, and is powerless to give others spiritual good:

> To this N.F. said: "I don't understand what you're troubling yourself about. After all, you won't be able to give those for whom you're troubling yourself anything except material well-being, since you don't admit to any other well-being; but meanwhile, working to obtain material well-being for others, you renounce it for yourselfand indeed are prepared even to sacrifice your life for the sake of this. But what if material well-being is no more important to those for whom you're troubling yourself than it is for you? To what end is all your bother?

Freedom & Equality cannot produce love. But love can produce freedom & equality.

> In the course conversation I heard from N. F. that the so-called great principles of the great French Revolution-freedom, equality, and brotherhood-are the product of extremely shallow thought, or even of thoughtlessness, since brotherhood cannot result from freedom to fulfill one's whims or from the envious desire for equality; only brotherhood leads to freedom, for brothers who love one another will not envy one brother who is elevated above others, and will not try to lower him to their own level; and the brother who has raised himself above the others will try to bring all his brothers up to his level. For that reason, we must seek brotherhood first and not put it at the tail, after freedom and equality, as did the proponents of freedom, equality, and brotherhood-we must seek brotherhood first, and the rest will follow.

Brotherhood demands fatherhood, family, nation.

> But there cannot be brotherhood without fatherhood and a fatherland-for only by fathers are we brothers, and therefore filial and paternal love must be placed at the head, and from this fraternal love will issue. Conversing in this manner, N. F. gradually unfolded an entire world outlook which was perfectly new to me, and which called for the unification of all people in a labor of universal resurrection.


### The Common Task

> "Neither Egoism nor Altruism, but Kinship"
> Fedorov

> nature is "our temporary enemy but permanent friend".
> Fedorov

> the phrase he used as early as the 1870S, "captain and crew of spaceship earth"

The universe is neither subject, nor object, but project.

> Fedorov's view that true knowledge is neither subjective nor objective, but "projective"

[[201904072159]] Liturgy as Vision of the world as it ought to be

> > That day, the one which the Lord shall accomplish through us, will be brought about not by the apparent movements of the sun, and not by the actual movement of the earth, but by the joint activity ofsons who have loved the God oftheir fathers and who have been filled with great compassion for all those departed.
> > ...
> > The awaited day, the day longed for through the ages, will be God's command and man's fulfillment.
> > Fedorov

>  Of all religions, only Christianity now celebrates the idea, and will in the future celebrate the fact, of resurrection. Thus true, active Orthodox Christianity will replace all today's conflicting religions, and all people will voluntarily join the common task ofresurrecting their ancestors, becoming Christian in deed regardless of nominal creed or religious upbringing.

Passive Optimism â€” Judaism
Passive Pessimism â€” Hinduism
Active Optimism â€” Zoroastrianism

### Is Fedorov influenced by esotericism?
1. He explicitly rejects them. And quotes them only to reject them.
2. The author claims resurrection is an esoteric pursuit, akin to alchemy.
3. The author claims Fedorov's affinity for Zoroastrianism is a pursuit of a "pure original" religion, and is thus esoteric.

### Autocracy
Fedorov believed in Autocracy/Dictatorship in rejection of Constitutionalism.
There are some connections to [[Democracy of the Dead]].
Fedorov sees autocracy as unity against the force of death, instead of unity against an external human force.
My intepretation is that Fedorov senses the need for vast unity. Much as I do today.

### Progress vs Resurrection
Fedorov rejected "progress" as the ideal of replacing the fathers with the childrenâ€”the glorification of cannibalism. Instead, the atonement for cannibalism must be resurrection.
