DBH on [[Gregory of Nyssa]]

> As Gregory argues in On the Making of Humanity, evil is inherently finite-in fact, in a sense, is pure finitude, pure limit- and so builds only toward an ending; evil is a tale that can have only an immanent conclusion; and, in the light of God's infinity, its proper end will be shown to be nothing but its own disappearance.
