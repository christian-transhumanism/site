[[Scientific Resurrection]] requires space exploration
[[quantum archaeology]] would be needed
This required hunting down far-flung "particles" or information
This necessitated conquering space

> To recover particles of disintegrated ancestors, Fedorov projected, research teams would have to travel to the moon, to the planets, and to distant points throughout the universe.
> Eventually these outer points of the cosmos would be colonized by the resurrected ancestors, whose bodies might be reengineered so they could live under conditions that could not now support human life as it is known.
