      2. An emerging theology of technology within the Christian tradition.
      3. A voice for positive, relational values within the broader transhumanist project.
      4. A positive religious vision that calls Christians to serve on behalf of the world.

  - question: "What do Christian Transhumanists oppose?"
    answer: |
      Most notably, versions of transhumanism that seek to lift up some at the expense of others.
  - question: "Why use the term “transhumanist”?"
    answer: |
      The term _transhumanism_ is a touchpoint for conversation between the billions of Christians in the world, and thinkers on the leading edges of science and technology. Historically, it has a rich background in Christian thought, apparently coined by Dante circa 1320, to reflect on notions of spiritual transformation. Now, it is commonly used to address the interface between humans and futuristic technologies, such as advanced prosthetics, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence.
  - question: "What is the history of the word “transhumanism”?"
    answer: |
      It originates with Dante in 1320, winds through Christian history, and is picked up in the work of Jesuit priest and paleontologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. Teilhard's friend Julien Huxley uses the term in 1957 in attempt to define a philosophy of humanity's ongoing transformation. This leads to secular transhumanism, as it is understood today.
