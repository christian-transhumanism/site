The [[Christian Transhumanist Association|CTA]] affirms the fundamental compatibility of Christianity and transhumanism. This compatibility can be established by the following points:

- History. Transhumanism was a Christian tradition, before it was a secular one.
- Philosophy. 
	- Christianity and transhumanism both promise the transformation of humanity, body and mind, along with the transformation of the physical world.
	- Christianity and transhumanism both affirm the fundamental importance of the physical world, and of the science and technology which embody humanity's impulses to transform it.
- Definitions.
	- Transhumanism can be understood as the ethical use of science and technology to transform the human condition.
	- Christianity can embrace that definition, and provide its own ethics to it.
