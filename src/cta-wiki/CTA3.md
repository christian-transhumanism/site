a mission to [[Secular Rationalists]], promoting Christianity as [[Rational Religion]].

- Examples of [[Transhumanism Supporting Faith]]
	- [[Transhumanism]] opens the door to religion-like narratives. This leads to both [[Ethical Techno-Optimism]], and [[Religious Aspirations through Science]].
	* [[Simulationism]] opens the door to creators, heavens, hells, miracles, and more. This makes us more open, at least hypothetically, to these religious visions. This leads to [[Rationalist Religious Cosmology]].
