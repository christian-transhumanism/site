# Cosmism > Unity through the Common Task of Resurrection
- The work of resurrection would necessarily unite the world. 
- Unbelievers, who in theory might find Christianity unacceptable, would, by resurrecting the dead, become in practice followers of Christ.

#explore Compare to unity project of [[Alexander Campbell]]?
Especially timeline. Fedorov was born in 1820s, so Campbell's project came significantly earlier.

[#Young2012]: George M. Young. The Russian Cosmists: The Esoteric Futurism of Nikolai Fedorov and His Followers. 2012.
