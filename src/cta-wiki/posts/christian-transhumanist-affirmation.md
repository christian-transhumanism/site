<p>Over the last few months, I've been working with the Board and&nbsp;the Membership Council, to craft a&nbsp;<em>Christian&nbsp;Transhumanist&nbsp;Affirmation</em>.&nbsp;<br /><br />Of course, trying to draft a list of ideas that we all agree on is quite an undertaking&mdash;and not something we will ever get exactly right! Nevertheless, we've moved forward, consulting with academic theologians, along with other different voices and perspectives. After many rounds of revisions, I'm proud to say that we've come up with a statement I believe captures a lot of our essence.</p>
<p><span>My hope is that this short statement can help to provide a sense of unity, and create a launching point for generative conversations among ourselves, and with those who are interested or curious about the intersection of Christianity &amp; Transhumanism.</span><br /><br /><span>This is a living document, which will evolve and grow in the years to come. We're not aiming for legalistic agreement and interpretation, but for an open-ended expression of our spirit and intent.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>I would love for you to join with members of our Board, our Membership Council, and our membership to read and sign it:</span></p>
