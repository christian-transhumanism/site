At the end of last month, we marked a historic moment for the CTA—completing our first full-board election, and appointing eight board seats.

We also said goodbye to several board members who have worked hard to bring us to this point. Among them were Dorothy Deasy and Christopher Benek, both of whom have served for the three years leading up to this election, and have been instrumental in our growth and formation so far.

Both of them have felt called to focus on other commitments, and have expressed their confidence that the CTA is at a point where others can step in and carry things forward.

I am incredibly grateful for their contributions and encouragement, as we have grown and developed in our vision and mission as an organization. Without them, we wouldn’t be where we are today.

Our new board consists of Robert Walden Kurtz, Emily Redding, Lincoln Cannon, Gabriel Redding, Neal Locke, Amy Gaskin, Jonathan Gunnell, and
James McLean Ledford.

The new board has hit the ground running with ideas and projects, and I am excited to be working with them on behalf of our community over the next several years.

These folks are your representatives, so be sure to reach out and make contact. You are at the core of our future, and we want to hear your ideas, your suggestions, and your hair-brained schemes.

Without you, this organization and this mission wouldn't be possible. Thanks again, and here's to a great year!
