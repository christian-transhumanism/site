# [[Nikolai Fedorov (1829-1903)|Fedorov]] condemned [[Tolstoy]] as a Buddhist

> Fedorov's objections to Tolstoy's late-period writings were chiefly that Tolstoy loved death and that while claiming to offer a simpler, truer form of Christianity, he was actually preaching neo-Buddhism. Tolstoy's doctrine of nontesistance was, to Fedorov, a total capitulation to the forces of nature, disintegration, and death.
