Following his bestselling Sapiens, Yuval Noah Harari examines where humanity is headed as we acquire god-like powers through technology, genetic engineering, and artificial intelligence. The book explores how dataism may become the dominant ideology, how algorithms might know us better than we know ourselves, and what it means to be human in an age where we can redesign life itself. Harari raises profound questions about the future of consciousness, intelligence, and human enhancement.
