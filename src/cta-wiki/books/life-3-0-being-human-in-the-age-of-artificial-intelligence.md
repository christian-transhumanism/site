MIT physicist Max Tegmark explores the future of artificial intelligence and what it means for humanity. The book examines the stages of life—from biological (Life 1.0) to cultural (Life 2.0) to technological (Life 3.0)—and discusses AI safety, consciousness, and the long-term future of intelligent life in the universe. Tegmark presents various scenarios for how AI might develop and emphasizes the importance of ensuring AI remains beneficial to humanity.
