Ray Kurzweil's influential book predicts a future where computers will match and exceed human intelligence. Published before his later work The Singularity Is Near, this book established many of the key concepts about accelerating technological change, the law of accelerating returns, and the eventual merger of human and machine intelligence. Kurzweil explores consciousness, the nature of intelligence, and what it means when machines become truly intelligent and even spiritual.
