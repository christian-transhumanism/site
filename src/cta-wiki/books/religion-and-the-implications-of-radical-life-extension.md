This volume raises important questions about the implications of radical life extension research from religious perspectives. An outstanding group of scholars brings ancient religious traditions to bear on the possibilities for radical life extension, offering fascinating challenges to both science and religion as longevity inches toward eternity. The anthology explores responses from representatives of world religions that are properly tentative and exploratory but extraordinarily provocative, stretching the imagination and confronting readers with mortality in a very different spirit.
