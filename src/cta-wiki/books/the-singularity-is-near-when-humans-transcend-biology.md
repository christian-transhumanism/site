Ray Kurzweil argues that we're about to experience a "Singularity", an intelligence explosion, where the intelligence embedded in our technology becomes greater than the intelligence embedded in human brains. This book explores what kinds of ramifications that might have for our near future. Ray Kurzweil is a long-time inventor, and has recently been brought onboard at Google to work on constructing an AI.
