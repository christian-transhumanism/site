# Image of God

At the 2019 Transvision conference in London, sociologist Steve Fuller declared that “Transhumanism is about the Image of God.” For Christians, this connection makes sense, since we see our scientific and technological capacity as part of how we reflect God’s own creative nature. We understand the image of God through these lenses:

- The Creation Mandate → [[Creation Mandate|Read More]]
- The Imitation of Christ (Participation in Christ) → [Read more](/mission/theological/participation-in-christ/)
- The Renewal of All Things → [Read more](/mission/theological/renewal-of-all-things/)

The Image of God entails both an eschatological [[likeness to God]], and a calling ([[Creation Mandate]]). It has historically been understood as connected to our Creative Rational nature, and to our Science and Technology. see [[Gregory of Nyssa]]
