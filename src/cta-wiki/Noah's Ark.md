When God decides to renew the world, he calls Noah to participate in this project of salvation by constructing the largest technological artifact the ancient world could imagine. 

Noah is treated as a kind of second Adam, a humanity rebooted. So just as God brought the animals to Adam in the garden to name, God brings the animals to Noah to care for and protect with his technological creativity. And when Noah emerges from the Ark, God reiterates the blessing of the [[Creation Mandate]] originally addressed to Adam. 

This is the Bibleâ€™s first story of redemption, and it involves humanity, God, creation, and human technological creativity.

Contrast that with the next story, the [[Tower of Babel]], in which humans reject God's aspirations for their growth and progress.
