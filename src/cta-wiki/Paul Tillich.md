#### Paul Tillich on Christian theology:

> In Christ the new mankind has started.  
> — Paul Tillich

> The profound doctrine of a transcendent humanism, a humanism which says that Christ is the fulfillment of essential man, of the Adamic nature.  
> — Paul Tillich

> I am always surprised how much better the theology of the ancient church was than the popular theology which developed in the nineteenth century, how much profounder and more adequate to the paradox of Christianity, without becoming irrationalistic, nonsensical, or absurd.  
> — Paul Tillich
