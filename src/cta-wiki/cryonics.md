The [[Christian Transhumanist Association|CTA]] is generally positive on the potential of cryonics. Extending life and health is good.

We must also concern ourselves, however, with the world we may wake up to on the other side. Who will revive us? Will they revive us from love, or hate? Will the revive us for blessing, or for revenge? Will they revive us merely to experiment on us? Will no one ever care enough to revive us at all?

These and similar questions suggest we should also proactively invest in the future society, and in acquiring goodwill that will last into that future. Jesus says something to this effect.

This may in turn suggest the need for churches, intergenerational communities, families, and so on.
