# Board Member Election

A few of our board members have just completed several fantastic years of service in CTA leadership. Which means that this month, we're electing new members to the Board of the Christian Transhumanist Association.

Who will those people be?

That's up to you. [Nominations are now open](/board-election-nomination/). We're looking for the people who can help lead these important efforts into the future. Maybe that's someone you know. Maybe it's *you*.

After we finish collecting nominations, our [voting members](/join/voting/) will elect the new board.

If you're not a voting member of the association, this is a great time to become one. You'll not only help advance this incredibly important conversation, you'll have a direct voice in who will lead it over the next three years. [Click here to make it official.](/join/voting/)

This is the process:

* [Nomination phase](/board-election-nomination/): March, first week
* [Discussion phase](/board-election-discussion/): March, second week
* [Voting phase](/board-election-voting/): March, third week
