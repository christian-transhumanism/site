The Rev. Dr. Ronald Cole-Turner is the H. Parker Sharp Professor of Theology and Ethics, a position relating theology and ethics to developments in science and technology. He is an ordained minister of the United Church of Christ, a founding member of the International Society for Science and Religion (currently serving as vice president), and has served on the advisory board of the John Templeton Foundation and the Metanexus Institute.

In 2016, Ron published <a href="http://amzn.to/2qAv3bU">The End of Adam and Eve: Theology and the Science of Human Origins</a>, exploring the latest developments in the science of human origins from the standpoint of theology. Now he is at work on theological response to transhumanism and the technologies of human enhancement, tentatively titled <em>Humanity Transcendent</em>. Cole-Turner is the author of <a href="http://amzn.to/2romnoe">Transhumanism and Transcendence: Christian Hope in an Age of Technological Advancement</a>, and the editor of <a href="http://amzn.to/2qFKdYt">Beyond Cloning: Religion and the Remaking of Humanity</a>.
