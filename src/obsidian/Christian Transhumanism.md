[[Christian Transhumanism]] is the name for a strain of Christian thinking going back through the Protestant Reformation, to the Patristic era, to the Jewish and Christian scriptures. It strongly influenced the [[Scientific Revolution]], the space race, and the emergence of modern futurism. 

[[Secular Transhumanism]] in modern times derives from [[Julian Huxley]], who was explicit in his aims to create a secularized Christianity for a secular world. 

In current times, [[Christian Transhumanism]] is a conversation, an area of study, a revival of ancient Christian theology, and an ethics of science and technology. Its most prominent form is the [[Christian Transhumanist Association]], which seeks to promote dialogue and awareness between people of faith, and the leading edges of science and technology.
