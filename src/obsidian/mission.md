# Our Three-Fold Mission

1.  [Theological mission](/mission/theological/). In a world where Christians often see science and technology as enemies of faith---**We believe that science and technology are part of the mission of Christ and of God**. *We as a community need to be able to share this understanding of the Christian story.*

2.  [Faith-renewing mission](/mission/faith/). In a world of rising skepticism and disenchantment---**We believe that engaging the future can help faith come alive**. *We as a community need to be able to show how the future can renew our faith, and the faith of individuals, families, communities, and the world.*

3.  [Technological mission](/mission/technological/). In a world of increasingly difficult ethical questions and challenges---**We believe that Christ offers an ethical vision for scientific and technological progress**. *We as a community need to be able to articulate and advocate for that ethical vision, and to enact it progressively in our own lives, and in the world around us.*
