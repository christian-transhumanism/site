### Q. What was the sin of Babel?

The sin of Babel is the rejection of God's plan for humanity's progress and rule.

What was the motivation behind the Tower of Babel? According to scripture, it was the rejection of God's explicit command to fill the earth, a command rooted in the [[Creation Mandate]].

> Then God blessed Noah and his sons, saying to them, "Be fruitful and increase in number and **fill the earth**…" (Genesis 9:1)

> 
> Then they said, "Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, **so that** we may make a name for ourselves; otherwise **we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth**." (Genesis 11:4)
> 
> [Tower happens, God intervenes]
> 
> So the Lord scattered them from there over **all the earth**, and they stopped building the city…From there the Lord scattered them over the face of **the whole earth**. (Genesis 11:8-9)

God had called humanity to spread into the world, to govern all things, in order to fulfill scripture's scientific and technological mission. These people rejected God's calling, and embraced a plan that would have limited humanity's progress before it got started. God disrupts their plan, and God's plan for humanity proceeds.

### Q. How tall could the tower have been?

The biblical story is explicit about the building materials (brick and tar), so we know the upper limits of the tower's construction.

According to [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/share/68d345eb-4250-8011-bf7f-589543fea139), its height could not be more than a couple hundred meters, and likely only around 91 meters. This matches the historical height of the ancient Mesopotamian ziggurats.

We have much taller buildings today.

### Q. Was the Tower of Babel intended to "storm the gates of heaven"?

Sometimes people assume the Tower of Babel was supposed to allow some kind of entrance to God's Heaven. The text does not say this (it says the tower's top was supposed to extend "into the heavens", that is, into the sky). 

Many people speculate on the larger backstory or motivations, but the only thing the Bible mentions is that they wanted to make a name for themselves, and avoid being "scattered". That is, they wanted to reject God's explicit command to fill the earth and fulfill the [[Creation Mandate]].
