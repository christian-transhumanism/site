a form of [[Christianity is necessary]], relating specifically to the [[Great Filter]]

- What is the actual Great Filter?
	- it is likely the self-destructive nature of intelligence itself
		- intelligence is the ultimate power
		- intelligence tends to be *unaligned*
		- unaligned intelligence leads to destruction
	- in practical terms, we can imagine accelerating intelligence leading to global war, and mutual destruction
- Thus,
	- Unaligned intelligence leads to destruction, but
	- [[Alignment requires Christ]]
