The Bible teaches that this cosmos will be renewed, and transformed into the future kingdom of God. Just as humans are to be renewed, the earth and the material cosmos will be renewed as well. 

When scripture talks about humans being renewed, it talks about it as a death and resurrection, or a destruction and new creation, or a new person replacing the old person. We naturally understand this language to speak of dramatic transformation. In a deeper sense, the person remains—otherwise renewal would be meaningless.

Similar language is used about the transformation of the material world. It is sometimes described as being "burned up", or being replaced with a "new creation". Yet this is interwoven with language that makes it clear that a deeper continuity remains. The material world longs for "new creation", not because it will be replaced, but because it itself will be preserved, restored, and renewed.

> Because everything you do in the present, in the power of the Spirit and in union with Christ, everything that flows out of love and hope and grace and goodness somehow will be part of God’s eventual Kingdom. That is the message of the resurrection.

> The gospel of the kingdom of God is not news from another world about another world. It is a gospel born from the history of God in this world for the sake of this world's future in the kingdom of God.
