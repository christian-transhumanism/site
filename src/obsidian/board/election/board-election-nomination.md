# Board Member Nomination

We're looking for the people who can help lead our mission into the future. Maybe that's someone you know. Maybe it's *you*.

After we finish collecting nominations, our voting members will elect the new board. This is a great time to become a [Voting Member](/join/voting/), and participate fully in helping to set the direction of our community over the next 3 years!

What is expected of Board Members?

* Board Members will serve for 3 years. 
* Board Members are expected to be [Voting Members](/join/voting/) ($100 annual dues) for the duration of their term.
* Board Members are expected to participate in monthly online board meetings, on the first Thursday of each month
* Board Members are expected to be available for questions and discussion via email (or Facebook Messenger)
* Board Members are asked to play a specific role within one of the [three mission areas](https://www.christiantranshumanism.org/blog/2022-three-missions-of-the-cta).
* Board Members are expected to advocate for the members of the Christian Transhumanist community, represent the CTA favorably to the outside world, and work to advance the purposes of the CTA via the unique skills and abilities they bring to the table.
