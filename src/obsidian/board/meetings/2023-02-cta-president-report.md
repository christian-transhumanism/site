### Website
* **Website down**
    * The members area of our website went down when Heroku deleted our database in December, with no recourse. 
        * We were on a paid plan, but the attached database was counted as a separate case.
        * Someone else describes this experience here:
            * https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34598563
    * This accelerated our ongoing move in the direction of low-code infrastructure. 
        * We decided on this direction for purposes of improving resilience and maintainability, and eliminating knowledge silos.

* **Website updated**
    * In the last month, I streamlined our website, and implemented the new system for membership management.
    * Current infrastructure
        * Heroku has been turned off
        * Github (currently free)
        * Netlify (currently free, may later be $19/month)
            * Redirects (can be implemented in other domain tools)
            * Eleventy.js build process (can be done locally)
            * Feed aggregation (can be done locally)
        * Mailchimp (currently free)
