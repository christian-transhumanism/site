Christian Transhumanism can be understood as a distinct ethical vision among the span of ethical visions that constitute the larger transhumanist movement. 

Within the transhumanist movement, there are various articulated ethics, from:

- (1) Radical individualism
    - Seeking to elevate oneself above all others.
    - A prime example of this ethic is Zoltan Istvan's "Transhumanist Wager".
- (2) Radical humanism
    - Seeking to elevate humanity together.
    - Particularly by erasing disease, poverty, suffering, and extending human life and well-being.
    - A prime example of this ethic is [[Humanity+]], formerly the World Transhumanist Association.
- (3) Radical environmentalism
    - Seeking to elevate the entire biosphere.
    - Particularly by bioengineering the elimination of animal suffering and predation.
    - (This often draws on biblical imagery, such as lions and lambs lying down together.)
    - A prime example of this is [[David Pearce]], co-founder of the World Transhumanist Association.

In the above framework, Christian Transhumanism can thus be understood as:

- (4) Radical Christian mission
    - Seeking to pursue the ethical imperative of Christ.
        - Transforming humanity into the likeness of Christ;
        - Healing diseases ([[Matthew 10.8]]), feeding the hungry, clothing the naked ([[Matthew 25.34-40]]);
        - extending human life and well-being;
        - elevating people together in compassion and trust.
    - This can entail both technological advocacy, and ethical advocacy.
    - A prime example of this is the Christian Transhumanist Association, and the larger Christian Transhumanist community.
