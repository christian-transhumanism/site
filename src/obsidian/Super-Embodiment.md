# Super-Embodiment

We stand on the cusp of new ways to meet human needs for agency, connection, relationality and creativity.

> "The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor" (Luke 4:18–19)

> "Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor have good news brought to them...and prisoners & oppressed are freed" (Luke 7:22)

> Feed the hungry, clothe the naked, care for the sick (Matthew 25:35–37)

> "Heal the sick, raise the dead, cure those with leprosy, and cast out demons." (Matthew 10:8)

## Human enhancement is coming

Technology to enhance humans will become as common as sunglasses.

We will become changed in ways that are hard to foresee with brain–computer interfaces and genetic engineering.

Already humans are enhanced with technological aids. We are moving ever closer to our technology, which continues to grow in power and decrease in size.

We will gain from interaction with smarter and smarter technology, including personal digital assistants and coaches, who will be able to help us grow and learn.

Enhancements to DNA will become routine for our offspring. This technology will not be able to be permanently stopped, so Christians must be at the forefront of the discussion.

Immediate human enhancement is available through a lively faith in God. As we are filled with the fruit of the Holy Spirit—in love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, humility and self‑control—we are becoming the humans God planned.

The first step to enhance humanity is the simplest, and the most ancient: to be in a relationship with the living God.

## Immediate actions

- Enhance yourself through relationship with Jesus and being filled with the Holy Spirit
- Use the Christian superpower of repentance—to change your mind, to act in accordance with God's standards
- Engage with technology in a positive way that makes you stronger, and connects you better. Cut out technology that makes you weaker or wastes your time.
- Plan your future. What kind of tech would you adopt as it becomes available? What would make good tech? Will you be an early adopter of some?
- Engage with human‑enhancing technology in the first instance for uplifting the poor and the disabled through education, spirituality, and technological support. Exoskeletons, brain–computer interfaces, and visual systems ("bionic eyes") are only a small step away from existing tech.
