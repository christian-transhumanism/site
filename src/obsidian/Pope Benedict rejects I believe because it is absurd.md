"'I believe because it is absurd' is not a formula that interprets the Catholic faith." — Pope Benedict XVI

"The Catholic Tradition, from the outset, rejected the so-called “fideism”, which is the desire to believe against reason. Credo quia absurdum (I believe because it is absurd) is not a formula that interprets the Catholic faith."

— Pope Benedict XVI
