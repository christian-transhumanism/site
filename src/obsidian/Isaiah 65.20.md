> the one who dies at a hundred  
    will be thought a mere child (Isaiah 65:20)

Isaiah portrays a future of [[Radical Longevity]], in which centenarians are considered to have only just begun to live. This echoes the vision of radical longevity ascribed to the holy forefathers of Genesis 4.

In short, long life is a blessing, is part of God's ultimate intention for humanity, and is part of the future that God has promised.
