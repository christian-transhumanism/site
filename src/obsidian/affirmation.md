<h1>The Christian Transhumanist Affirmation</h1>

<br />

<h4>As members of the Christian Transhumanist Association:</h4>

<br />

<div class="" id="1">
<b>1. We believe that God’s mission involves the transformation and renewal of creation</b> including humanity, and that we are called by Christ to participate in that mission: working against illness, hunger, oppression, injustice, and death.
</div><br />
<div class="" id="2">
<b>2. We seek growth and progress along every dimension of our humanity:</b> spiritual, physical, emotional, mental—and at all levels: individual, community, society, world.
</div><br />
<div class="" id="3">
<b>3. We recognize science and technology as tangible expressions of our God-given impulse to explore and discover</b> and as a natural outgrowth of being created in the image of God.
</div><br />
<div class="" id="4">
<b>4. We are guided by Jesus’ greatest commands</b> to “Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength…and love your neighbor as yourself.”
</div><br />
<div class="" id="5">
<b>5. We believe that the intentional use of technology, coupled with following Christ, can empower us to grow into our identity</b> as humans made in the image of God.
</div><br />

<h4>In this way we are Christian Transhumanists.</h4>
