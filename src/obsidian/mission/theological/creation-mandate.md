# The Creation Mandate

### Humanity's calling and purpose

> **Genesis 1:26‚Äì28**  
> Then God said, ‚ÄúLet us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.‚Äù
>
> So God created mankind in his own image,
    in the image of God he created them;
    male and female he created them.
> 
> God blessed them and said to them, ‚ÄúBe fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.‚Äù

These lines appear on the first page of the Bible. They are not filler, nor abstract theology. They are the very axis of Scripture and civilization.

They tell us two things:

- Our **identity**: we are made to be like God.  
- Our **calling**: we are made to rule creation.  

This is **The Creation Mandate**.

### What It Means to Rule

![Edenic garden scene with humans tending animals and plants, symbolizing cultivation not exploitation](https://res.cloudinary.com/christian-transhumanist-association/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_400,dpr_auto/v1757347759/generated/micahredding_creation_of_the_world_genesis_big_bang_all_creatur_93cec104-a758-430d-a3b5-01ea3d718e11.png){: .figure-right}

To rule creation is not to exploit it but to cultivate it. The text lists fish, birds, livestock, wild animals‚Äîmeant to be read as ‚Äúall creatures, great and small.‚Äù Psalm 8 expands:

> ‚ÄúYou made them rulers over the works of your hands; you put _everything_ under their feet‚Äù (Psalm 8:6).

Hebrews 2 makes the claim explicit:

> ‚ÄúIn putting everything under them, God left _nothing_ that is not subject to them‚Äù (Hebrews 2:8).

Humanity is called to rule everything that God created. But ruling is not extraction. God‚Äôs own rule is creative and generative‚Äîobserving, naming, separating, ordering, cultivating, blessing, and bringing forth life. Humanity‚Äôs rule must look the same.

At its simplest, this looks like agriculture. Farmers separate, organize, and tend so that life multiplies. In Eden, humans were placed in a garden ‚Äúto work it and take care of it.‚Äù Animals were brought to Adam to be named, just as God had named creation. Naming assigned a place in an ordered system, an ecosystem organized for greater flourishing.

This is science and technology, in their most basic form: observing the world, and organizing it for greater life. God had exemplified this process in his own work of creation, giving humans the first version of a scientific method, and instructing them to follow it. The 17th century scientific revolution drew on this pattern specifically.

The mandate is to extend this ordering, naming, and cultivating to every part of God's creation.

### Science and Technology as Cultivation

![Futuristic laboratory blending science and sacred imagery, symbolizing technology as extension of creation mandate](https://res.cloudinary.com/christian-transhumanist-association/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_400,dpr_auto/v1757348346/generated/micahredding_a_person_looking_down_over_a_wide_expansive_wooded_878783b8-8500-442a-9a9a-33ef29cadc21.png){: .figure-right}

> **Pull Quote**: *Science and technology are not alien to Scripture. They are extensions of our God-given likeness.*

- **Noah‚Äôs Ark**: God calls Noah to build the greatest technology of the ancient world, in order to preserve life.  
- **Science**: Kepler described discovery as ‚Äúthinking God‚Äôs thoughts after him.‚Äù Our investigations uncover general revelation (Romans 1:20).  
- **Technology**: Naming, categorizing, and ordering creation empower life to flourish.  

üí° **Side Note:** Today, this means governing microbes and molecules, reading and editing DNA, and mastering biology. Disease and death are failures of rule. To rule rightly is to heal and sustain life.

### What Went Wrong

![Darkened garden scene with humanity turned away, creation groaning, symbolizing the Fall](https://res.cloudinary.com/christian-transhumanist-association/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_400,dpr_auto/v1757347781/generated/micahredding_the_six_days_of_creation_according_to_Genesis_1_0b75db2f-dc42-45bc-a999-1e737e061e12.png){: .figure-right}

The Creation Mandate is conditional: we are made to be like God __*so that*__ we can rule. Falling short distorts the rule.

> **Genesis 3** describes humanity going astray, leading to humanity's rule being broken. The result is toil, pain, alienation, and death. 

> **1 Corinthians 15:21**  
> ‚ÄúDeath came through man.‚Äù  

> **Romans 8:19‚Äì21**  
> ‚ÄúCreation waits‚Ä¶ to be liberated from its bondage to decay.‚Äù  

Creation suffers because humanity is broken. The biblical story is the path of restoration: humanity regaining God-likeness and recovering its true vocation, so that creation can flourish.

### Like God

![Jesus teaching and blessing, depicted as the true image of God, surrounded by people and creation](https://res.cloudinary.com/christian-transhumanist-association/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_400,dpr_auto/v1757348300/generated/micahredding_a_map_of_concentric_circles_with_a_human_in_the_ce_72c66c16-7b3b-4693-8535-e7e55b0f301a.png){: .figure-right}

What does it mean to be like God? Genesis already shows us:  

- God **creates**.  
- God **names**.  
- God **orders**.  
- God **blesses**.  
- God **delights** in creation‚Äôs fruitfulness.  

‚û° Humanity is to rule with the same character: cultivating, empowering, blessing.  

> **Exodus 20:9‚Äì11**  
> Human work is patterned on God‚Äôs work: six days of labor, one of rest.  Our creative work is to be like God's own creative work.

> **Matthew 5:44‚Äì48**  
> Jesus: ‚ÄúLove your enemies‚Ä¶ be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.‚Äù  

Jesus, the true image of God, embodies the likeness we were made for. To imitate him is to recover the Creation Mandate.

### Genesis of the Future

![Visionary futuristic city flourishing with greenery, technology, and life, symbolizing humanity cultivating the cosmos](https://res.cloudinary.com/christian-transhumanist-association/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_400,dpr_auto/v1757347764/generated/micahredding_galaxy_of_living_creatures_cosmos_551e5465-1bf8-4d85-a2cf-d4389a462fe1.png){: .figure-right}

The Creation Mandate promises:  

- Science and technology as expressions of God-likeness.  
- Healing and medicine as governance of creation.  
- A future of creativity, cultivation, and endless life.  

The Creation Mandate diagnoses:  

- Why humanity suffers death and decay.  
- Why creation groans under futility.  
- Why Christ is necessary to restore humanity‚Äôs vocation.  

The Creation Mandate is the Bible in miniature. And it shows us why, when we do [participate in Christ](/mission/theological/participation-in-christ/), [all things will be renewed](/mission/theological/renewal-of-all-things/).
