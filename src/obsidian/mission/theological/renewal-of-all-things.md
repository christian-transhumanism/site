# The Renewal of All Things

> “For the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed… in hope that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God.” (Romans 8:19–21)

> “Truly, I tell you, at the renewal of all things…” — Jesus (Matthew 19:28–30)

> “…until the time comes for the restoration of all things” — Peter (Acts 3:21)

> “Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.” — Jesus (Matthew 6:10)

Christians are called to work for the improvement of this present world. Escapist theologies bear bad fruit, such as a willingness to sacrifice the environment, awaiting a “helicopter rescue” from God, and failing to be salt and light for the preservation and enhancement of society.

Scripture calls us to hope for the world to continue to improve, and to have faith that Christ’s principles will usher in unparalleled benefits for Earth.
