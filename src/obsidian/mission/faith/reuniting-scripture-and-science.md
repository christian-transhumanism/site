# Reuniting Scripture and Science

Many people think the Bible contradicts modern science. But a closer look shows that Scripture and science, when rightly understood, actually reinforce and illuminate one another. Scripture affirms the intelligibility of creation, and science uncovers the depth of that intelligibility. Together, they reveal God’s purposes for humanity and the world.

## Scripture Affirms Science

From the very beginning, the Bible portrays the universe as ordered, purposeful, and good.

- Genesis 1 declares creation to be intelligible: light divided from darkness, land from sea, seasons from one another.  
- The psalmist proclaims, “The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands.” (Psalm 19:1)  
- Paul writes, “Since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities…have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made.” (Romans 1:20)

These affirmations imply that the world can be studied, measured, and understood. In other words, **the biblical worldview is a foundation for science itself.**

## Reading Genesis 1 as Narrative

Genesis 1 is not a scientific manual, nor a textbook in physics or biology. It is a theological narrative and liturgical proclamation:

- Structured in a seven-day rhythm, Genesis presents God’s creative work as ordered and purposeful.  
- Exodus 20 explicitly grounds the human workweek in this pattern: *“Six days you shall labor and do all your work…for in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth.”* Our rhythm of work and rest imitates God’s creative actions.  
- The text culminates in humanity, made in God’s image, entrusted with the [Creation Mandate](/mission/theological/creation-mandate/).  

Genesis 1’s purpose is not to set physical timelines but to frame human vocation: to mirror God’s creative work in the world. This liturgical vision allows us to honor the text’s intent without forcing it into categories it was never written to answer.

## Age of the Earth and Evolution

When we recognize Genesis 1 as theological narrative, it does not restrict the age of the earth. Other biblical texts even acknowledge the world’s deep antiquity (e.g., Psalm 90:2).  

The Genesis story itself portrays a trajectory of ascending complexity—from light, to land and plants, to animals, to humanity—that broadly parallels how evolution describes life’s unfolding. Genesis is not a rival to science but a proclamation that the order science studies is God’s gift and purpose.

## Science in God’s Plan

Science is not an alien intrusion into faith. It is a natural outgrowth of the biblical vision:

- Humanity is commanded to “fill the earth and subdue it” (Gen 1:28)—a calling that includes discovery, innovation, and cultivation.  
- Biblical figures from Noah to Solomon are portrayed using wisdom, observation, and technology to fulfill their callings.  
- The prophets envision a renewed creation where wisdom and knowledge cover the earth (Isaiah 11:9, Habakkuk 2:14).

Far from undermining faith, science becomes a means of fulfilling humanity’s vocation to understand and care for creation.

## Reuniting Scripture and Science Today

When we interpret Scripture according to its genre, and science according to its methods, the conflict dissolves. Both serve a larger truth: God’s purposes for creation and humanity.

- Scripture gives the **why**: creation’s purpose, humanity’s role, and the hope of renewal.  
- Science gives the **how**: the processes, mechanisms, and history through which God’s creation unfolds.  

To reunite Scripture and science is to see them as complementary voices in the same symphony. Each expands our vision of God’s world, deepens our discipleship, and strengthens our faith.

**The upshot:** The Bible does not contradict science—it inspires it. Genesis 1, read as narrative, affirms an ordered creation and humanity’s vocation within it. Science uncovers the depth of that order. Together, Scripture and science call us into awe, responsibility, and hope.
