# Super-Ecology

We stand on the cusp of radically expanded possibilities for cultivating life.

> "For the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed. ...in hope that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God." (Romans 8:19–21)

## Creation Mandate

- We must care for and cultivate all life.
- We are the only species with the power to protect Earth.
- Humans are niche‑creators. We create niches and adapt ourselves to them.
- New Heaven and New Earth are better, not a reversion to Eden.

## Cultivating Nature

God created (or created the emergence process for) our biosphere as our home. So far, we have greatly influenced many other species, largely to the negative. We should now seek to not only reverse the damage, but to enhance and build a better future.

Humans may proactively, transparently, and by international agreement choose to use geoengineering and species recreation to restore and enhance the Earth.

## Digital Ecology

Our environment includes not only our physical environment but also our technological and digital ecosystems.

The network must become a place of learning and growth, instead of hatred, division and exploitation. Communication now allows anyone to learn anything. There is no more powerful way to foster international social justice and the elimination of poverty through education.

Technological power must be decentralized, and directed towards human empowerment and agency.

## Politics and Society

An age of superabundance may occur, and privilege may become defined not by access to resources, but by differences in genetics, family structure and culture.

Our political system must evolve. We should strive for societies with a strong safety net, and a foundation that poverty and lack of opportunity is eliminated, whilst not constraining how high our most productive can fly.

As AI improves and moves towards AGI, these will empower human political parties. Such technology should be transparent and accountable. Our politicians should lead for unity, and debate transparently and fairly. Current political debates cause division and hate.

## Expanding Ecology

We advocate for humans to establish new habitats in space, including on the moon, Mars and other places in the solar system, including artificial bodies. This should include 'terraforming' or enhancing these environments, while protecting and caring for any life or life‑like predecessors that may exist.

We look to a future where the Earth is renewed. Scripture speaks of divine intervention appearing both directly and in human lives to recreate the Earth. Such renewal can spread throughout the cosmos wherever renewed humanity can travel.

Scripture can be used to support various eschatologies. Scripture calls us to hope in and work towards a [renewal of all things](/mission/theological/renewal-of-all-things/) eschatology.

## Immediate actions

- Advocate for investment to advance technology which will heal the planet.
- Champion spiritual renewal in our online milieus.
- Champion spiritual renewal of humans, which will also renew the environment.
- Consider a future of space development, in context of our human vocation and optimisation, that life should continue in the event of global catastrophe.
