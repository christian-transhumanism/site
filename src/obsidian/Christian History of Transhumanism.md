[[Christian Transhumanism]] is the name for a strain of Christian thinking going back through the Protestant Reformation, to the Patristic era, to the Jewish and Christian scriptures. It strongly influenced the [[Scientific Revolution]], the [[space race]], and the emergence of modern futurism. 

[[Secular Transhumanism]] in modern times derives from [[Julian Huxley]], who was explicit in his aims to create a secularized Christianity for a secular world. 

In current times, [[Christian Transhumanism]] is a conversation, an area of study, a revival of ancient Christian theology, and an ethics of science and technology. Its most prominent form is the [[Christian Transhumanist Association]], which seeks to promote dialogue and awareness between people of faith, and the leading edges of science and technology.

    - "The human species can, if it wishes, transcend itself — not just sporadically, an individual here in one way, an individual there in another way, but in its entirety, as humanity. We need a name for this new belief. **Perhaps transhumanism will serve: man remaining man, but transcending himself, by realizing new possibilities of and for his human nature.** "I believe in transhumanism": once there are enough people who can truly say that, the human species will be on the threshold of a new kind of existence, as different from ours as ours is from that of Pekin man. It will at last be consciously fulfilling its real destiny." — Julian Huxley
- 1958 [[CS Lewis]]
	- [[CS Lewis]] critiqued the secular transhumanism of his own day, and articulated a vision—incomplete at times—of a Christian Transhumanism, expansive, immersive, colorful, and full of diverse forms of life, drawn from the Eastern and Patristic traditions of Christianity.
