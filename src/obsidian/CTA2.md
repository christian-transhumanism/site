a mission to [[Deconstructing Christians]] helping to [[Faith-Renewing Mission|Renew Faith]] by drawing on ideas such as:

* _Evolution Theology_ says that evolution is a process of increasing complexity, diversity, and connection, leading to ever-greater wholes. Faith means participating in this process. The Spirit is what drives this process, Christ is increasingly embodied in this process. This leads to [[Rationalist Religious Cosmology]].
* _Ecosystem of Heaven_. This vision of a future interplanetary ecosystem allows us to reify evolutionary visions into concrete technological projects. This leads to [[Ethical Techno-Optimism]].
* _Tree of Souls?_ Many people on this pathway reject conventional religious aspirations. But perhaps by locating resurrection and immortality within the *Ecosystem of Heaven*, as outworkings of evolutionary and ecological life, traditional religious aspirations can be re-introduced. This might look somewhat untraditional: perhaps more like the fictional Tree of Souls in James Cameron's Avatar, for example. If this connection worked, this would lead to [[Religious Aspirations through Science]].
