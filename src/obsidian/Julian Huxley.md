- "The human species can, if it wishes, transcend itself — not just sporadically, an individual here in one way, an individual there in another way, but in its entirety, as humanity. We need a name for this new belief. **Perhaps transhumanism will serve: man remaining man, but transcending himself, by realizing new possibilities of and for his human nature.** "I believe in transhumanism": once there are enough people who can truly say that, the human species will be on the threshold of a new kind of existence, as different from ours as ours is from that of Pekin man. It will at last be consciously fulfilling its real destiny." — Julian Huxley

Usually considered the author of modern [[Secular Transhumanism]]. 

Huxley wrote [[Religion without Revelation]], detailing his aspiration to secularize religion. 

Huxley was friends with [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin|Teilhard de Chardin]] (Christian transhumanist thinker) and developed his ideas in correspondence with Teilhard de Chardin. Huxley wrote the forward to Teilhard de Chardin's posthumous book [[The Phenomenon of Man]], expressing his support for the ideas, though he could not embrace their religious aspects fully.

Transhumanism was the name Huxley ultimately gave to the resultant philosophy.
