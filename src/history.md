# The History of the Christian Transhumanist Association

### Prehistory

Christian Transhumanism is a modern name for a stream of Christian thought that has existed for 2000 years. That stream of thought built the universities, gave us the scientific revolution, and inspired the space race.

Key thinkers who connect this ancient stream of thought to today include:
- [[Francis Bacon]] (16th century), formulated the scientific method, inspired the founding of [[The Royal Society]], and pushed for radical longevity and other transhumanist scientific projects, inspired by his Christian faith, and his friends among the translators of the King James Bible.
- [[Nikolai Fedorov (1829-1903)|Nikolai Fedorov]] (19th century), Russian Orthodox thinker, inspired the space race as part of his Christian eschatology.
- [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin|Teilhard de Chardin]] (20th century), Jesuit priest and paleontologist, who sought to reconcile evolution and Christianity, and ended up formulating a theory of the future, anticipating the internet and the [[Singularity]], and—through his friendship with [[Julian Huxley]]—inspiring the modern secular transhumanist movement.
- [[Frank Tipler]] (20th-21st century), a cosmologist who inspired many in the 1980s-1990s secular transhumanist movement. In 1994, he published [[The Physics of Immortality (1994)]] in which he proposed a transhumanist view of God. Many early members of the [[Christian Transhumanist Association|CTA]], such as [[Micah Redding]] and [[Neal Locke]], read this book at the time, and became Christian Transhumanists. Tipler himself eventually became a Christian.

### Initial Interest Group (2013)

On June 6th, 2013, Micah Redding [posted a signup form](https://www.facebook.com/groups/332924799454/permalink/10151616121344455/) [b](https://archive.is/oR5fW) for those interested in forming a Christian Transhumanist Association.

On July 7th, 2013, Micah Redding published a [Call for Interest](http://micahredding.com/blog/2013/07/07/interested-christian-transhumanism) in a Christian Transhumanist Association, and [Giulio Prisco](http://turingchurch.com/2013/07/08/a-christian-transhumanist-association/) publicized it farther. That call led 24 additional people to sign a statement of interest. This culminated with the launch of a [Christian Transhumanist Association discussion group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/christian-transhumanism) on November 1, 2013. 

### Formal Organization (2014)

Over the next several months, [we discussed purpose, direction, and plans](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/christian-transhumanism/PJ4rknxyq5Q/F7RK1XXyo7oJ), through both email and video chats, as new people joined in. On March 29, 2014, Christopher Benek joined the discussion.

On April 3, 2014, the group decided to [form an organizational task force](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/christian-transhumanism/iyZove2Nbv0/UZjGfG7MQjsJ), and on April 11, 2014, we held a video hangout for those wishing to do the initial legwork to get the group going. Those attending were Micah Redding, Christopher Benek, and Dorothy Deasy.

The group determined that they should file for legal recognition, and we began working on that process. The association was formally recognized by the state of Tennessee on May 15, 2014, with Micah Redding as Executive Director, and board member positions as required by the state: Christopher Benek (chair), Dorothy Deasy (secretary), and Emily Redding (treasurer).

That was just state recognition, however, and so the long process of acquiring 501c3 status began.

On July 30, 2014, the first bylaws were adopted. What followed was further paperwork and preparation. 

### 501c3 (2015)

In January 2015, the application for 501c3 status was officially filed with the IRS. In December 2015, we received official recognition from the IRS as a 501c3.

In February 2015, with the [[CTA Launch Announcement]], a month-long membership campaign began. By the end of the month, approximately 14 people had signed up and contributed to the campaign, becoming founding members of the association. 

In March 2015, we held elections for our first Membership Advisory Council, selected by the voting members.

### First Donation and Logo (2015)

On October 6, 2015, the CTA announced its first major donation, with a $1200 gift to the [Embrace Infant Warmer](https://www.christiantranshumanism.org/embrace_announcement) project, signifying our commitment to the combination of technology, compassion, and respect for human life.

Also announced was the first [CTA Logo](http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/micah/sites/1/meta_images/original/outside.png?1444100555), selected by the membership campaign donors.

Over the next few months, in conjunction with pastors, academics, laypeople, and the Board and the Membership Advisory Council, we composed the [Christian Transhumanist Affirmation](https://www.christiantranshumanism.org/affirmation), which was circulated for public signing on March 30, 2016.

### Affirmation (2016)

Over the next few months, in conjunction with pastors, academics, laypeople, and the Board and the Membership Advisory Council, we composed the [Christian Transhumanist Affirmation](https://www.christiantranshumanism.org/affirmation), which was circulated for public signing on March 30, 2016.

### Humanity+ (2017)

In July 2017, [Humanity+ affiliated with the Christian Transhumanist Association](https://www.christiantranshumanism.org/blog/humanity-plus-affiliation).

### Conferences (2018-2019)

On August 25th, 2018, the first ever Christian Transhumanist Conference [[CTA Conference 2018]] was held at Lipscomb University in Nashville, TN, with keynote speaker Aubrey de Grey.

On October 19th, 2019, the second Christian Transhumanist Conference [[CTA Conference 2019]] was held at Lipscomb University in Nashville, TN, with keynote speakers Science Mike and Liz Parrish.
