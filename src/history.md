# The History of the Christian Transhumanist Association

### Origins (2013-2014)

The Christian Transhumanist Association originated in a small community of people on blogs and online discussion groups in the early parts of 2013.

On June 6th, 2013, Micah Redding [posted a signup form](https://www.facebook.com/groups/332924799454/permalink/10151616121344455/) for those interested in forming a Christian Transhumanist Association.

On July 7th, 2013, Micah Redding published a [Call for Interest](http://micahredding.com/blog/2013/07/07/interested-christian-transhumanism) in a Christian Transhumanist Association, and [Giulio Prisco](http://turingchurch.com/2013/07/08/a-christian-transhumanist-association/) publicized it farther. That call led 24 additional people to sign a statement of interest. Those initial names include:

_Micah Redding, Lincoln Cannon, James M Ledford, Jason Xu, Jordan Rastrick, Giulio Prisco, Ilia Stambler, Therese Price, Siddartha S Verma, David Hamilton, Thomas Nowell, Micko Hjort, Joe Nickence, Hanno van Tonder, Dorothy Deasy, Snooz, Richard Lyne, Vicky Beeching, John Jastrow, Dan Hegelund, Ryan Hogan, Pace Ellsworth, Andrés Gómez Emilsson, James Michael Moffett, Peter Tovarich_

This culminated with the launch of a [Christian Transhumanist Association discussion group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/christian-transhumanism) on November 1, 2013. 

Over the next several months, [we discussed purpose, direction, and plans](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/christian-transhumanism/PJ4rknxyq5Q/F7RK1XXyo7oJ), through both email and video chats, as new people joined in. On March 29, 2014, Christopher Benek joined the discussion.

On April 3, 2014, the group decided to [form an organizational task force](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/christian-transhumanism/iyZove2Nbv0/UZjGfG7MQjsJ), and on April 11, 2014, we held a video hangout for those wishing to do the initial legwork to get the group going. Those attending were Micah Redding, Christopher Benek, and Dorothy Deasy.

The group determined that they should file for legal recognition, and we began working on that process. The association was formally recognized by the state of Tennessee on May 15, 2014, with Micah Redding as Executive Director, and board member positions as required by the state: Christopher Benek (chair), Dorothy Deasy (secretary), and Emily Redding (treasurer).

### Membership Launch, 501c3, and Board Reorganization (2014-2017)

That was just state recognition, however, and so the long process of acquiring 501c3 status began.

On July 30, 2014, the first bylaws were adopted. What followed was further paperwork and preparation. 

In January 2015, the application for 501c3 status was officially filed with the IRS.

In February 2015, a month-long membership campaign began. By the end of the month, approximately 14 people had signed up and contributed to the campaign, becoming founding members of the association. Those names include: _David Winyard, Jack Zaleski, Josiah Redding, Dan Hegelund, Mark Waser, John Michael Maier, Jonathan Burchel, James Ledford, Lincoln Cannon, Carl Youngblood, R Michael Perry, Jonathan Gunnell_ .

In March 2015, we held elections for our first Membership Advisory Council, selected by the voting members. Our first membership council consisted of: _James Ledford, Lincoln Cannon, Jonathan Gunnell, Dan Hegelund, Ryan Hogan_.

On October 6, 2015, the CTA announced its first major donation, with a $1200 gift to the [Embrace Infant Warmer](https://www.christiantranshumanism.org/embrace_announcement) project, signifying our commitment to the combination of technology, compassion, and respect for human life.

Also announced was the first [CTA Logo](http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/micah/sites/1/meta_images/original/outside.png?1444100555), selected by the membership campaign donors.

In December 2015, we received official recognition from the IRS as a 501c3.

Over the next few months, in conjunction with pastors, academics, laypeople, and the Board and the Membership Advisory Council, we composed the [Christian Transhumanist Affirmation](https://www.christiantranshumanism.org/affirmation), which was circulated for public signing on March 30, 2016.

In 2016, a new Membership Advisory Council was elected, consisting of _Lincoln Cannon, Amy Henry Gaskin, Jonathan Gunnell, Ryan Hogan, Neal Locke_. There was much discussion about how to continue the evolution of the CTA.

On July 18, 2016, the Board and the Membership Advisory Council were merged, creating an operating board consisting of: _Christopher Benek, Dorothy Deasy, Emily Redding, Lincoln Cannon, Amy Henry Gaskin, Jonathan Gunnell, Ryan Hogan, Neal Locke_.

In early 2017, Christopher Benek and Dorothy Deasy announced they would step down, to let others serve, and to focus on other activities that could be of help.

### Current Management Structure (2017-2022)

This led to the first full board election in March 2017, with 8 seats to be filled. The winners of that election: _Lincoln Cannon, Emily Hogan Redding, Amy Gaskin, Jonathan Gunnell, Robert Walden Kurtz, James Ledford, Neal Locke, Gabriel Redding_.

James Ledford later resigned, and Timothy Langer was appointed to fill the vacancy.

In July 2017, [Humanity+ affiliated with the Christian Transhumanist Association](https://www.christiantranshumanism.org/blog/humanity-plus-affiliation).

In March 2018, three board seats were up for re-election, and those elected were _Jonathan Gunnell, Mark Russell, and Mike Morrell_. In April, Agbolade Omowole, Jenne Erigero Alderks, and Heather Goodman were appointed to one-year officer positions.

On August 25th, 2018, the first ever [Christian Transhumanist Conference](/conference/2018) was held at Lipscomb University in Nashville, TN, with keynote speaker Aubrey de Grey.

In March 2019, three board seats were up for re-election, and those elected were _Neal Locke, Lincoln Cannon, and Blaire Ostler_ .

On October 19th, 2019, the second [Christian Transhumanist Conference](/conference/2019) was held at Lipscomb University in Nashville, TN, with keynote speakers Science Mike and Liz Parrish.

In March 2020, three board seats were up for re-election, and those elected were 

_Omar Reyes, 
Lorenzo Barberis Canonico (COO), 
and Micah Redding (CEO)._ .

In March 2021, four board seats were up for election, and those elected were 

_Martha Bucaram, 
Jonathan Gunnell, 
Elias Kruger, 
Mark Russell_.

In March 2022, three board seats were up for election, and those elected were

_Lincoln Cannon,
MacKenzie Fisher, 
Caleb Strom_.
