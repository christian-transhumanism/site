# Participation in Christ

**Christ is the Image of God.** Scripture states, “The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being” (Hebrews 1:3). Christ thus reveals what we are intended to become.

**Christ is our ethical calling.** Christ’s ethics are humility, love, and vocationally dedicating himself to the transformation of humanity. Christians are called to develop the characteristics of Christ.

> “In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus: Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death, even death on a cross!” (Philippians 2:5–8)

**We will be like Christ.** Participation in the nature of Christ is a basic calling for all Christians.
> “And we, who with unveiled faces contemplate the Lord's glory, are being transformed into his image with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.” (2 Corinthians 3:18)
> “Put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.” (Ephesians 4:24)

The CTA advocates for Christians to express this humility and love of Christ by dedicating their lives and careers to useful technological development, and rejecting the empty display of consumerism, and other false values of the secular world.
