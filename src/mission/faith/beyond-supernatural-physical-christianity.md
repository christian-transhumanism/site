# Beyond Supernatural: The Physical Vision of Christianity

Christianity’s core hope is radically embodied: **resurrection, renewal of creation, and the redemption of physical life.**  

Unlike spiritualities that retreat into the “otherworldly” or philosophies that dissolve the self into abstraction, the Christian vision insists that matter matters. God’s redemptive purposes are not a break from creation, but its fulfillment. In the biblical imagination, God is not portrayed as breaking the laws of nature, but guiding them to ultimate fulfillment for and through humanity. The gospel proclaims not the abandonment of creation, but its *new creation*.

## The Problem with “Supernatural”

Modern discourse tends to divide the world into “natural” and “supernatural.” This division is both historically recent and theologically misleading.

- The Bible does not describe God’s action as occasional interruptions from outside the system.  
- Instead, creation itself is an expression of God’s will, and God continues to act within it.  
- As David Bentley Hart notes, the term *supernatural* has a very specific and limited history—and one that does not capture the heart of Christian teaching.

The early church saw salvation not as a **magical escape** or a **forensic declaration**, but as a transformation of reality itself. The Orthodox and Catholic traditions describe salvation as an **organic transfiguration of the creature in Christ,** a glorification that affirms rather than negates our creatureliness.

This vision cuts against modern assumptions that faith is either “belief without evidence” or “the supernatural invading the natural.” Christianity insists instead that creation and redemption belong together.

## Miracles as Glimpses of the Future

We often imagine miracles as violations of natural law. But Scripture itself suggests a different frame:

> “Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and all that night the Lord drove the sea back with a strong east wind…” (Exodus 14:21–22)

Here, the miracle of the Exodus is described as a convergence of natural forces and divine purpose. The east wind was no less physical for being God’s chosen means of salvation.

N. T. Wright reframes miracles as part of the continuum of divine causation:

> “A more biblical account would recognize the strange, steady work of God within so-called natural causes, so that the sudden and shocking new event is held within a larger continuum of ultimate divine causation.”

Miracles are not arbitrary violations of nature. They are **signposts of the future God intends**—moments where the curtain lifts and the ultimate destiny of creation shines through. They are not exceptions to creation but revelations of creation’s goal.

In this sense, every miracle is eschatological: a glimpse of resurrection, a foretaste of new creation, an embodied preview of the world to come.

## The Creation Mandate and Human Vocation

From the beginning, humanity has been called into a physical, creative partnership with God.

- **Genesis 1–2**: Humanity is created in God’s image and tasked with cultivating the earth.  
- **Noah**: Faithful obedience involves technological innovation—designing and building the ark.  
- **Psalm 8 / Hebrews 2 / 1 Corinthians 15**: Humanity’s vocation is to bear God’s image and steward creation, a calling fulfilled in Christ and extended to those who share in his reign.

Science and technology, far from being threats to faith, are part of this vocation. They represent humanity’s God-given drive to understand, shape, and extend creation toward its flourishing. To reject them is to reject part of the mandate. To embrace them in faith is to join in God’s redemptive work.

## Faith Beyond Supernaturalism

Faith, then, is not irrational leap or superstition. It is:

- **Confidence** that all truth is God’s truth.  
- **Trust** that the Creator’s purposes are good.  
- **Commitment** to act, even in the face of fallibility and incomplete knowledge.  

Faith is not opposed to science; it is the posture that makes true science possible. Because we “know in part” (1 Cor 13:9), we must test, learn, and act with humility. Because we trust in God’s goodness, we act with confidence and hope.

## Beyond Supernatural

Christianity envisions not escape, but **embodiment.** Resurrection is not the negation of the body but its renewal. Salvation is not detachment from the world, but its reconciliation and transfiguration.

- Miracles are not supernatural interruptions, but windows into the physical future God promises.  
- Science and technology are not profane, but integral to humanity’s vocation.  
- Faith is not anti-reason, but the confident call to act in trust and hope, even amid incomplete knowledge.  

**The upshot:** Christianity is a faith with a *physical* vision for the world—scientific, technological, embodied, and redeemed. To go “beyond supernatural” is to recognize that God’s future for creation is not disembodied escape, but the full flowering of the physical world in Christ.
