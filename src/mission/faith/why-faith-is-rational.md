# Why Faith Is Rational

<!-- Intro content coming soon. This article explores how Christian faith aligns with robust reasoning and evidence while embracing humility and fallibilism. -->

> We stand on a mountain pass in the midst of whirling snow and blinding mist, through which we get glimpses now and then of paths which may be deceptive. If we stand still we shall be frozen to death. If we take the wrong road we shall be dashed to pieces. We do not certainly know whether there is any right one. What must we do? 'Be strong and of a good courage.' Act for the best, hope for the best, and take what comes...If death ends all, we cannot meet death better.
> — Fitz James Stephen 

> “Suppose, for instance, that you are climbing a mountain, and have worked yourself into a position from which the only escape is by a terrible leap. Have faith that you can successfully make it, and your feet are nerved to its accomplishment. But mistrust yourself...and you will hesitate so long that, at last, all unstrung and trembling, and launching yourself in a moment of despair, you roll in the abyss. ...
> Refuse to believe, and you shall indeed be right, for you shall irretrievably perish. But believe, and again you shall be right, for you shall save yourself.“
> — William James

> But howsoever important these facts taken from the constituted sciences may be, they are not enough; for faith is before all else an impetus to action, while science, no matter how far it may be pushed, always remains at a distance from this. __Science is fragmentary and incomplete; it advances but slowly and is never finished; but life cannot wait.__
> — Emile Durkheim, The Elementary Forms of Religious Life

> “Hope is at the heart of existence. It seeks an outlet at every level of human life. Where there is life, there is hope. And “where there is hope, there is religion”, says Bloch. We will add: where religion becomes total hope, there is Christianity.” 
> — The Future of God, Carl E Braaten

In the face of existential uncertainty, we must take action. We may be doomed, all may be lost—such is always possible. Yet we must embrace hope. It is the only ethical choice, indeed, the only rational choice. And hope must instill in us a commitment and a drive towards action, which is faith.

To hope and act, we need only accept the basic premise of all religion: That life and intelligence can overcome all things.

But once accepted, we have become religious people, people of faith. It is then only a matter of how fully that faith will develop. 

Will we begin to trust that life can overcome death and disease? Will we begin to trust that evils can be eradicated? Will we begin to trust that the cosmos can be transformed? Will we begin to trust that the dead can be raised?

Will we begin, in other words, to embrace total hope, total faith, and total love? 

Will we embrace Christianity?
