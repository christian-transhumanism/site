# The Convergence Hypothesis

The Convergence Hypothesis holds that transhumanism and futurism specifically, and science and technology generally, are converging on the rediscovery of ancient religious concepts—often in new and unexpected forms.

While a more general convergence thesis can be seen as a long-standing feature of science-religion dialogue, the Convergence Hypothesis suggests that specific features of transhumanism and futurism uniquely foster this convergence.

The most obvious features are:

- **A focus on the future**. Science-religion dialogue has tended to collapse many of its questions into the present or the past. For Christianity, however, the most profound areas of concern lie in the ultimate future. Transhumanism and futurism, by exploring this space, uncover many of the same concepts that were part of ancient religious thought.
- **A focus on the potential**. Science-religion dialogue has tended to collapse many of its questions into the actual. For Christianity, however, many of its most profound areas of concern are about potential: the potential of the human person, the potential nature and existence of superhuman beings, the potential for a reconciliation of power and benevolence, the potential elimination of suffering. Transhumanism and futurism, by exploring this space, uncover many of the same concepts that were part of ancient religious thought.
- **A focus on action**. Science-religion dialogue has tended to collapse many of its questions into purely intellectual concerns. For Christianity, however, the most pressing issues are always questions of action: What must we do? Transhumanism and futurism, by orienting themselves towards questions of action, uncover many of the same concepts that were part of ancient religious thought.

Common examples of this convergence are the Simulation Hypothesis, the Great Filter, scenarios of biosphere revival, de-extinction, and elimination of predation, articulation of various potential kinds of life and intelligence, quantum archaeology, cryonics, and the prospects of radical abundance.

In measured terms, these contemporary ideas explore the concepts of creation/creator, apocalypse and eschatology, gods, spirits, and demons, heavens and hells, resurrection and immortality. They re-open questions of incarnation and theodicy; and they make it possible to articulate incredibly nuanced theological perspectives in new terms.

For Christians, there are strong theological reasons to expect such a convergence. The concept of General Revelation, expressed in Romans 1:20 and throughout scripture, leads us to anticipate that all serious inquiries will lead to the same conclusions. Less appreciated is that scripture anticipates General Revelation to challenge believers as well—particularly when non-believers articulate such revelation in unfamiliar terms.

This convergence is thus both a challenge and an opportunity. For those who see it as a threat, it is the greatest competition on offer. For those who are open to new discoveries, it offers the opportunity to participate in radical new kinds of dialogue in progress.

> “For the scientist who has lived by his faith in the power of reason, the story ends like a bad dream. He has scaled the mountains of ignorance, he is about to conquer the highest peak; as he pulls himself over the final rock, he is greeted by a band of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries.”

Robert Jastrow articulates one way of experiencing this convergence. But The Convergence Hypothesis suggests we search for a more optimistic framing: the story doesn’t end in a bad dream, but in a glorious awakening to what we have all been hoping for all along.
