# Why Faith Is Rational

When people think of faith, they often imagine it as blind belief or stubborn certainty. But biblically and philosophically, faith is something deeper: confidence to act amid uncertainty, oriented toward truth.  

Critical Rationalism—the epistemology developed by Karl Popper and others—helps make sense of this. It rejects the futile search for absolute proofs and instead emphasizes **conjecture and critique**: proposing bold ideas and testing them rigorously. This framework aligns closely with the Christian vision of faith.

## Conjecture and Critique

Critical Rationalism rests on two simple insights:

- **We cannot prove ultimate truths.** All knowledge is fallible, incomplete, and subject to revision.  
- **We progress through criticism.** By testing, questioning, and refining our ideas, we get closer to the truth.  

This mirrors how faith functions in Scripture:

- “Now I know in part; then I shall know fully” (1 Corinthians 13:9).  
- “Those who say they know something do not yet know as they ought” (1 Corinthians 8:2).  

Faith is not about closing down questions but about opening ourselves to ongoing transformation in the pursuit of truth.

## Faith as Confident Action Under Uncertainty

Faith does not mean certainty. It means **trust strong enough to act** in the absence of certainty.  

- Abraham set out for a land he did not know (Hebrews 11:8).  
- The disciples followed Christ without understanding the full picture.  
- Christians today live by entrusting themselves to Christ’s story, testing it out in life, community, and history.  

In Popperian terms: **we conjecture that Christianity is true, and we test that conjecture through our lives.** Faith is not blind—it is experimental, lived, and tested.

## Humility and Hope

Critical Rationalism emphasizes fallibilism: the recognition that we may be wrong. This is not a weakness but a strength, because it opens the door to correction, dialogue, and growth.  

Christian faith echoes this posture:

- Faith acknowledges the limits of human knowledge.  
- Faith listens, learns, and seeks wisdom together in community.  
- Faith combines humility with confidence: because we trust God’s character, we can act boldly even when we do not know everything.

This balance—humility before truth, confidence in action—is the heart of biblical faith.

## Faith as Truth-Seeking

Faith is not belief *against* reason. It is belief aligned with truth-seeking:

- Faith expects that **all truth is God’s truth.**  
- Faith is willing to test and revise, because truth can withstand testing.  
- Faith embraces science, philosophy, and history as partners in the search for reality.  

As Robert Jastrow once observed of the scientist climbing the mountain of knowledge, at the summit we find theologians already waiting. Faith and reason, far from being opposites, are complementary paths in the same pursuit.

## Living the Epistemology of Faith

To live by faith is to:

- Conjecture boldly that Christ holds the truth.  
- Test that conviction through practice, obedience, and love.  
- Remain open to critique, correction, and deeper understanding.  
- Act with humility and hope, even in uncertainty.  

**The upshot:** Faith is not irrational. It is the most rational response to life in an uncertain world: confident trust in God, tested in history and lived out in practice, always open to growth and correction.

> We stand on a mountain pass in the midst of whirling snow and blinding mist, through which we get glimpses now and then of paths which may be deceptive. If we stand still we shall be frozen to death. If we take the wrong road we shall be dashed to pieces. We do not certainly know whether there is any right one. What must we do? 'Be strong and of a good courage.' Act for the best, hope for the best, and take what comes...If death ends all, we cannot meet death better.

Have faith that you can successfully make it, and your feet are nerved to its accomplishment. But mistrust yourself...and you will hesitate so long that, at last, all unstrung and trembling, and launching yourself in a moment of despair, you roll in the abyss. ...

> But howsoever important these facts taken from the constituted sciences may be, they are not enough; for faith is before all else an impetus to action, while science, no matter how far it may be pushed, always remains at a distance from this. __Science is fragmentary and incomplete; it advances but slowly and is never finished; but life cannot wait.__

> “Hope is at the heart of existence. It seeks an outlet at every level of human life. Where there is life, there is hope. And “where there is hope, there is religion”, says Bloch. We will add: where religion becomes total hope, there is Christianity.” 
> — The Future of God, Carl E Braaten

In the face of existential uncertainty, we must take action. We may be doomed, all may be lost—such is always possible. Yet we must embrace hope. It is the only ethical choice, indeed, the only rational choice. And hope must instill in us a commitment and a drive towards action, which is faith.

To hope and act, we need only accept the basic premise of all religion: That life and intelligence can overcome all things.

But once accepted, we have become religious people, people of faith. It is then only a matter of how fully that faith will develop. 

Will we begin to trust that life can overcome death and disease? Will we begin to trust that evils can be eradicated? Will we begin to trust that the cosmos can be transformed? Will we begin to trust that the dead can be raised?

Will we begin, in other words, to embrace total hope, total faith, and total love? 

Will we embrace Christianity?
