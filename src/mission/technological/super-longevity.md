# Super-Longevity

We stand on the cusp of several medical revolutions, each as profound as the discovery of antibiotics.

> "Never again will there be in it an infant who lives but a few days, or an old man who does not live out his years; the one who dies at a hundred will be thought a mere child…" (Isaiah 65:20)

> "God did not make death, nor does he rejoice in the destruction of the living. For he fashioned all things that they might have being…" (Wisdom 1:13-14)

Two-thirds of deaths are attributable to aging-related diseases such as heart disease, stroke, cancer and dementia. Many years of creative relational living are lost to osteoporosis, sarcopenia and arthritis.

Addressing the underlying processes of aging (including the 'hallmarks of aging' described by López-Otín et al.) has moved from fringe to mainstream. Powerful investment and scientific forces are working on this. It should soon be recognised by the World Health Organisation.

## Emerging medical fields

### Molecular level

- Emerging medicines including RNA
- Drugs and supplements
- Tweaking the performance of our genome, including DNA repair and enhancement

### Cellular level

- Senolytic drugs
- Stem cells, including Yamanaka factors
- Nanobot cell replacements, for example for red blood cells

### Organ level

- Bioprinting organs using scaffolds and seeding
- Replacing organs with biomechanical devices
- Regenerating organs within your body

## Immediate actions

Physical life is just the start. Keeping our bodies healthy must be matched with keeping our minds sharp and productive in creative and relational communities, and keeping our spirituality vibrant. "This is eternal life, that we may know you, the only true God" (John 17:3).

For those interested in conserving their body and living as long as practical to accomplish God's mission, CTA recommends taking steps today in the following areas by priority:

- Medical checks and blood screening
- Vocation, spiritual life and community, stress and sleep
- Understanding your genome risks and acting on them
- Exercise
- Diet
- Supplements and emerging medicines
- Learn and prepare for future technology

Starting from your current baseline, prioritise action in each area to optimize your health-span.

CTA advocates for this knowledge to be widely shared, and in the immediate term, for simple medical improvements, for example trials of emerging medicines to treat the 'hallmarks of aging'.
