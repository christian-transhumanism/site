An outstanding group of scholars brings ancient religious traditions to bear on the possibilities for radical life extension, offering fascinating challenges to both science and religion as longevity inches toward eternity. The anthology explores responses from representatives of world religions that are properly tentative and exploratory but extraordinarily provocative, stretching the imagination and confronting readers with mortality in a very different spirit."

Biohacking, the attempt at human enhancement of physical, cognitive, affective, moral, and spiritual traits, has become a global phenomenon. This textbook introduces religious and ethical implications of biohacking, artificial intelligence, and other technological changes, offering perspectives from monotheistic and karmic religions and applied ethics. These technological breakthroughs are transforming our societies and ourselves fundamentally via genetic modification, tissue engineering, artificial intelligence, robotics, the merging of computer technology with human biology, extended reality, brain stimulation, and nanotechnology."

Although they may sound like science fiction, the possibilities suggested by transhumanism are very real, and the questions they raise have no easy answers. If these enhancementsâ€”especially major ones like the indefinite extension of healthy human lifeâ€”become widely available, they would arguably have a more radical impact on humankind than any other development in history. This book comprises essays that explore transhumanism and the issues that surround it, addressing numerous fascinating questions posed by scholars of religion from various traditions."
